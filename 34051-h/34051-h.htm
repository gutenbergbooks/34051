<p>The realm of an idea may often be defined by geometrical <span class="pag">[1]</span> lines.</p>

<p><span class="side">The geographical boundaries of Latin Christianity.</span>If from Rome, as a centre, two lines be drawn, one of which passes
eastward, and touches the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus, the other
westward, and crosses the Pyrenees, nearly all those Mediterranean
countries lying to the south of these lines were living, at the time of
which we speak, under the dogma, "There is but one God, and Mohammed is
his prophet;" but the countries to the north had added to <span class="pag">[2]</span> the <a id="orthodox2"></a>orthodox
conception of the Holy Trinity the adoration of the Virgin, the worship
of images, the invocation of saints, and a devout attachment to relics
and shrines.</p>


<p><span class="side">Forces acting upon it.</span>I have now to relate how these lines were pushed forward on  Europe, that
to the east by military, that to the west by intellectual force. On Rome,
as on a pivot, they worked; now opening, now closing, now threatening to
curve round at their extremes and compress paganizing Christendom in
their clasp; then, through the convulsive throes of the nations they had
inclosed, receding from one another and quivering throughout their whole
length, but receding only for an instant, to shut more closely again.</p>

<p>It was as if from the hot sands of Africa invisible arms were put forth,
enfolding Europe in their grasp, and trying to join their hands to give
to paganizing Christendom a fearful and mortal compression. There were
struggles and resistances, but the portentous hands clasped at last.
Historically, we call the pressure that was then made the Reformation.</p>

<p>Not without difficulty can we describe the convulsive struggles of
nations so as to convey a clear idea of the forces acting upon them. I
have now to devote many perhaps not uninteresting, certainly not
uninstructive, pages to these events.</p>

<p>In this chapter I begin that task by relating the consequences of the
state of things heretofore described&mdash;the earnestness of converted
Germany and the immoralities of the popes.</p>




<p><span class="side">The Germans insist on a reform in the papacy.</span>The Germans insisted on a reformation among ecclesiastics, and that they
should lead lives in accordance with  religion. This moral attack was
accompanied also by an intellectual one, arising from another source, and
amounting to a mutiny in the Church itself. In the course of centuries,
and particularly during the more recent evil times, a gradual divergence
of theology from morals had taken place, to the dissatisfaction of that
remnant of thinking men who here and there, in the solitude of
monasteries, compared the dogmas of theology with the dictates of reason.
Of those, and the number was yearly <span class="pag">[3]</span>increasing, <a id="who3"></a>who had been among the
Arabs in Spain, not a few had become infected with a love of philosophy.</p>




<p><span class="side">Reappearance of philosophy.</span>Whoever compares the tenth and twelfth centuries together cannot fail to
remark the great intellectual advance which Europe was making. The ideas
occupying the minds of Christian men, their very turn of  thought, had
altogether changed. The earnestness of the Germans, commingling with the
knowledge of the Mohammedans, could no longer be diverted from the misty
clouds of theological discussion out of which Philosophy emerged, not in
the Grecian classical vesture in which she had disappeared at Alexandria,
but in the grotesque garb of the cowled and mortified monk. She timidly
came back to the world as Scholasticism, persuading men to consider, by
the light of their own reason, that dogma which seemed to put common
sense at defiance&mdash;transubstantiation. Scarcely were her whispers heard
in the ecclesiastical ranks when a mutiny against authority arose, and
since it was necessary to combat that mutiny with its own weapons, the
Church was compelled to give her countenance to Scholastic Theology.</p>

<p>Lending himself to the demand for morality, and not altogether refusing
to join in the intellectual progress, a great man, Hildebrand, brought on
an ecclesiastical reform. He raised the papacy to its maximum of power,
and prepared the way for his successors to seize the material resources
of Europe through the Crusades.</p>



<p><span class="side">The three pressures upon Rome.</span>Such is an outline of the events with which we have   now to deal. A
detailed analysis of those events shows that there were three directions
of pressure upon Rome. The pressure from the West and that from the East
were Mohammedan. Their resultant was a pressure from the North: it was
essentially Christian. While those were foreign, this was domestic. It is
almost immaterial in what order we consider them; the manner in which I
am handling the subject leads me, however, to treat of the Northern
pressure first, then of that of the West, and on subsequent pages of that
of the East.</p>



<p><span class="side">Foreign influence for reforming the papacy.</span>It had become absolutely necessary that  something should be done for the
reformation of the papacy. Its crimes, such as we have
related in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31345/31345-h/31345-h.htm#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter&nbsp;XII., Vol.&nbsp;I.,</a> <a id="outraged4"></a>outraged <span class="pag">[4]</span> religious  men.
 To the master-spirit of the
movement for accomplishing this end we must closely look. He is the
representative of influences that were presently to exert a most
important agency.</p>





<p><span class="side">Life of Gerbert.</span>In the train of the Emperor Otho&nbsp;III., when he  resolved to put a stop to
all this wickedness, was Gerbert, a French ecclesiastic, born in
Auvergne. In his boyhood, while a  scholar in the Abbey of Avrillac, he
attracted the attention of his superiors; among others, of the Count of
Barcelona, who took him to Spain. There he became a proficient in the
mathematics, astronomy, and physics of the Mohammedan schools. <span class="side">His Saracen education.</span>
He spoke Arabic  with the fluency of a Saracen.
His residence at Cordova, where the khalif patronized all the  learning and science of the age, and his
subsequent residence in Rome, where he found an inconceivable ignorance
and immorality, were not lost upon his future life. He established a
school at Rheims, where he taught logic, music, astronomy, explained
Virgil, Statius, Terence, and introduced what were at that time regarded
as wonders, the globe and the abacus. He laboured to persuade his
countrymen that learning is far to be preferred to the sports of the
field. He observed the stars through tubes, invented a clock, and an
organ played by steam. He composed a work on Rhetoric. Appointed Abbot of
Bobbio, he fell into a misunderstanding with his monks, and had to retire
first to Rome, and then to resume his school at Rheims. In the political
events connected with the rise of Hugh Capet, he was again brought into
prominence.
<span class="side">His reproaches against the Church.</span>
 The speech of the Bishop of Orleans at the Council of Rheims,
which was his composition, shows us how his Mohammedan education had led
him to look upon  the state of things in Christendom: "There is not one at
Rome, it is notorious, who knows enough of letters to qualify him for a
door-keeper; with what face shall he presume to teach who has never
learned?" He does not hesitate to allude to papal briberies and papal
crimes: "If King Hugh's embassadors could have bribed the pope and
Crescentius, his affairs had taken a different turn." He recounts the
disgraces and crimes <span class="pag">[5]</span> of <a id="the5"></a>the pontiffs: how John&nbsp;XII. had cut off the nose
and tongue of John the Cardinal; how Boniface had strangled John&nbsp;XIII.;
how John&nbsp;XIV. had been starved to death in the dungeons of the Castle of
St. Angelo. He demands, "To such monsters, full of all infamy, void of
all knowledge, human and divine, are all the priests of God to
submit&mdash;men distinguished throughout the world for their learning and
holy lives? The pontiff who so sins against his brother&mdash;who, when
admonished, refuses to hear the voice of counsel, is as a publican and a
sinner." With a prophetic inspiration of the accusations of the
Reformation, he asks, "Is he not Anti-Christ?" He speaks of him as "the
Man of Sin," "the Mystery of Iniquity." Of Rome he says, with an emphasis
doubtless enforced by his Mohammedan experiences, "She has already lost
the allegiance of the East; Alexandria, Antioch, Africa, and Asia are
separate from her; Constantinople has broken loose from her; the interior
of Spain knows nothing of the pope." He says, "How do your enemies say
that, in deposing Arnulphus, we should have waited for the judgment of
the Roman bishop? Can they say that his judgment is before that of God
which our synod pronounced? The Prince of the Roman bishops and of the
apostles themselves proclaimed that God must be obeyed rather than men;
and Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles, announced anathema to him, though
he were an angel, who should preach a doctrine different to that which
had been delivered. Because the pontiff Marcellinus offered incense to
Jupiter, must, therefore, all bishops sacrifice?" In all this there is
obviously an insurgent spirit against the papacy, or, rather, against its
iniquities.</p>


<p><span class="side">His ecclesiastical advancement.</span>In the progress  of the political movements Gerbert was appointed to the
archbishopric of Rheims. On this occasion, it is not without interest
that we observe his worldly wisdom. It was desirable to conciliate the
clergy&mdash;perhaps it might be done by the encouragement of marriage. He had
lived in the polygamic court of the khalif, whose family had occasionally
boasted of more than forty sons and forty daughters. Well then may he
say, "I prohibit not marriage. I condemn not second marriages. I do not
blame the  <span class="pag">[6]</span>eating <a id="of6"></a>of flesh." His election not only proved unfortunate,
but, in the tortuous policy of the times, he was removed from the
exercise of his episcopal functions and put under interdict. The speech
of the Roman legate, Leo, who presided at his condemnation, gives us an
insight into the nature of his offence, of the intention of Rome to
persevere in her ignorance and superstition, and is an amusing example of
ecclesiastical argument: "Because the vicars of Peter and their disciples
will not have for their teachers a Plato, a Virgil, a Terence, and the
rest of the herd of philosophers, who soar aloft like the birds of the
air, and dive into the depths like the fishes of the sea, ye say that
they are not worthy to be door-keepers, because they know not how to make
verses. Peter is, indeed, a door-keeper&mdash;but of heaven!" He does not deny
the systematic bribery of the pontifical government, but justifies it.
"Did not the Saviour receive gifts of the wise men?" Nor does he deny the
crimes of the pontiffs, though he protests against those who would expose
them, reminding them that "Ham was cursed for uncovering his father's
nakedness." In all this we see the beginning of that struggle between
Mohammedan learning and morals and Italian ignorance and crime, which was
at last to produce such important results for Europe.</p>



<p>Once more Gerbert retired to the court of the emperor. It was at the time
that Otho&nbsp;III. was contemplating a revolution in the empire and a
reformation of the Church. He saw how useful Gerbert might be to his
policy, and had him appointed Archbishop of Ravenna.
<span class="side">Gerbert the pope.</span>
On the death of Gregory&nbsp;V. he issued his decree for the election of Gerbert as pope. The
low-born French ecclesiastic, thus attaining to the utmost height of
human ambition, took the name of Sylvester&nbsp;II.</p>



<p>But Rome was not willing thus to surrender her sordid interests; she
revolted. Tusculum, the disgrace of the papacy, rebelled. It required the
arms of the emperor to sustain his pontiff. For a moment it seemed as if
the Reformation might have been anticipated by many centuries&mdash;that
Christian Europe might have been spared the abominable papal disgraces
awaiting it.
<span class="side">Poisoning of the emperor and pope.</span>
There was a learned and upright pope, an able and youthful
<span class="pag">[7]</span> emperor; <a id="but7"></a>but Italian revenge, in the person of Stephania, the wife of
the murdered Crescentius, blasted all these expectations. From the hand
of that outraged and noble criminal, who, with more than Roman firmness
of purpose, could deliberately barter her virtue for vengeance, the
unsuspecting emperor took the poisoned cup, and left Rome only to die. He
was but twenty-two years of age. Sylvester, also, was irretrievably
ruined by the drugs that had been stealthily mixed with his food. He soon
followed his patron to the grave. His steam organs, physical experiments,
mechanical inventions, foreign birth, and want of orthodoxy, confirmed
the awful imputation that he was a necromancer. The mouth of every one
was full of stories of mystery and magic in which Gerbert had borne a
part. Afar off in Europe, by their evening firesides, the goblin-scared
peasants whispered to one another that in the most secret apartment of
the palace at Rome there was concealed an impish dwarf, who wore a
turban, and had a ring that could make him invisible, or give him two
different bodies at the same time; that, in the midnight hours, strange
sounds had been heard, when no one was within but the pope; that, while
he was among the infidels in Spain, the future pontiff had bartered his
soul to Satan, on condition that he would make him Christ's vicar upon
earth, and now it was plain that both parties had been true to their
compact. In their privacy, hollow-eyed monks muttered to one another
under their cowls, "Homagium diabolo fecit et male finivit."</p>



<p>To a degree of wickedness almost irremediable had things thus come. The
sins of the pontiffs were repeated, without any abatement, in all the
clerical ranks. Simony and concubinage prevailed to an extent that
threatened the authority of the Church over the coarsest minds.
Ecclesiastical promotion could in all directions be obtained by purchase;
in all directions there were priests boasting of illegitimate families.
<span class="side">Commencing protest in the Church against its sins.</span> But yet, in the Church itself there were men of irreproachable life, who,
like Peter Damiani, lifted up their voices against the prevailing
scandal. He it was who proved that nearly every priest in Milan had
purchased his preferment and lived with a concubine. <span class="pag">[8]</span> The <a id="immoralities8"></a>immoralities
thus forced upon the attention of pious men soon began to be followed by
consequences that might have been expected. It is but a step from the
condemnation of morals to the criticism of faith. The developing
intellect of Europe could no longer bear the acts or the thoughts that it
had heretofore submitted to. The dogma of transubstantiation led to
revolt.</p>



<p><span class="side">Primitive agreement of philosophy and theology.</span>The early fathers delighted to point out the agreement of doctrines
flowing from the principles of Christianity with those of Greek
philosophy. For long it was asserted that a correspondence between faith
and reason exists; but by degrees as one dogma after another of a
mysterious and unintelligible kind was introduced, and matters of belief
could no longer be co-ordinated with the conclusions of the
understanding, it became necessary to force the latter into a subordinate
position. <span class="side">Their gradual alienation.</span>
The great political interests involved in these questions
suggested the expediency and even necessity of compelling such a
subordination by the application of civil power. In this manner, as we
have described, in the reign of Constantine the Great, philosophical
discussions of religious things came to be discountenanced, and implicit
faith in the decisions of existing authority required. Philosophy was
subjugated and enslaved by theology. We shall now see what were the
circumstances of her revolt.</p>


<p>In the solitude of monasteries there was every inducement for those who
had become weary of self-examination to enter on the contemplation of the
external world. Herein they found a field offering to them endless
occupation, and capable of worthily exercising their acuteness.<span class="side">The mutiny against theology commences among the monks.</span> But it
was not possible for them to take the first step without offending
against the decisions established by authority. The alternative was
stealthy proceeding or open mutiny; but before mutiny there occurs a
period of private suggestion and another of more extensive discussion.
<span class="side"> Persecution of Gotschalk,</span>
It was thus that the German monk Gotschalk, in the ninth century, occupied
himself  in the profound problem of predestination, enduring the scourge
and death in prison for the sake of his opinion. The <span class="pag">[9]</span> presence <a id="of9"></a> of the
Saracens in Spain offered an incessant provocation to the restless
intellect of the West, now rapidly expanding, to indulge itself in such
forbidden exercises. Arabian philosophy, unseen and silently, was
diffusing itself throughout France and Europe, and churchmen could
sometimes contemplate a refuge from their enemies among the infidel. In
his extremity, Abelard himself looked forward to a retreat among the
Saracens&mdash;a protection from ecclesiastical persecution.</p>




<p><span class="side">who sets up reason against authority.</span> In the conflict with Gotschalk on the matter of predestination was
already foreshadowed the attempt to set up reason against authority. John
Erigena, who was employed by Hincmar, the Archbishop of Rheims, on that
occasion, had already made a pilgrimage to the birthplaces of Plato and
Aristotle, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;825, and indulged the hope of uniting philosophy and
religion in the manner proposed by the ecclesiastics who were studying in
Spain.</p>



<p><span class="side">John Erigena falls into Pantheism.</span>From Eastern sources John Erigena had learned the doctrines of the
eternity of matter, and even of the creation, with which, indeed, he
confounded the Deity himself. He was, therefore, a Pantheist; accepting
the Oriental ideas of emanation and absorption not only as respects the
soul of man, but likewise all material things. In his work "On the Nature
of Things," his doctrine is, "That, as all things were originally
contained in God, and proceeded from him into the different classes by
which they are now distinguished, so shall they finally return to him and
be absorbed in the source from which they came; in other words, that as,
before the world was created, there was no being but God, and the causes
of all things were in him, so, after the end of the world, there will be
no being but God, and the causes of all things in him." This final
resolution he denominated deification, or theosis. He even questioned the
eternity of hell, saying, with the emphasis of a Saracen, "There is
nothing eternal but God." It was impossible, under such circumstances,
that he should not fall under the rebuke of the Church.</p>




<p><span class="side">The conflict begins on transubstantiation.</span>Transubstantiation, as being, of the orthodox doctrines, the least
reconcilable to reason, was the first to be attacked by the new
philosophers. What was, perhaps, in <span class="pag">[10]</span> the <a id="beginning10"></a>beginning, no more than a jocose
Mohammedan sarcasm, became a solemn subject of ecclesiastical discussion.
Erigena strenuously upheld the doctrine of the Stercorists, who derived
their name from their assertion that a part of the consecrated elements
are voided from the body in the manner customary with other relics of
food; a doctrine denounced by the orthodox, who declared that the priest
could "make God," and that the eucharistic elements are not liable to
digestion.</p>




<p><span class="side">Opinions of Berengar of Tours. </span>And now, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1050, Berengar of
 Tours prominently brought forward the
controversy respecting the real presence. The question had been
formularized by Radbert under the term transubstantiation, and the
opinions entertained respecting the sacred elements greatly differed;
mere fetish notions being entertained by some, by others the most
transcendental ideas. In opposition to Radbert and the orthodox party,
who asserted that those elements ceased to be what to the senses they
appeared, and actually became transformed into the body and blood of the
Saviour, Berengar held that, though there is a real presence in them,
that presence is of a spiritual nature. These heresies were condemned by
repeated councils, Berengar himself being offered the choice of death or
recantation. He wisely preferred the latter, but more wisely resumed his
offensive doctrines as soon as he had escaped from the hands of his
persecutors. <span class="side">The pope privately adopts them.</span>
As might be supposed from the philosophical indefensibility
of the orthodox doctrine, Berengar's opinions, which, indeed, issued from
those of Erigena, made themselves felt in the highest ecclesiastical
regions, and, from the manner in which Gregory&nbsp;VII. dealt with the
heresiarch, there is reason to believe that he himself had privately
adopted the doctrines thus condemned.</p>


<p><span class="side">Peter Abelard among the insurgents.</span>But it is in Peter Abelard that we find the representative of the
insurgent spirit of those times. The love of Heloisa seems in our eyes to
be justified by his extraordinary intellectual power. In his Oratory,
"The Paraclete," the doctrines of faith and the mysteries of religion
were without any restraint discussed. No subject was too profound or too
sacred for his contemplation. <span class="side">St. Bernard attacks him.</span>
By the powerful and orthodox influence of
St. Bernard, "a morigerous and mortified monk," the opinions of Abelard
were brought under the rebuke of the authorities. In vain he appealed
from the Council of Sens to Rome; the <span class="pag">[11]</span> power <a id="of11"></a>of St. Bernard at Rome was
paramount. "He makes void the whole Christian faith by attempting to
comprehend the nature of God through human reason. He ascends up into
Heaven; he goes down into hell. Nothing can elude him, either in the
height above or in the nethermost depths. His branches spread over the
whole earth. He boasts that he has disciples in Rome itself, even in the
College of Cardinals. He draws the whole earth after him. It is time,
therefore, to silence him by apostolic authority." Such was the report of
the Council of Sens to Rome, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1140.</p>


<p>Perhaps it was not so much the public accusation that Abelard denied the
doctrine of the Trinity, as his assertion of the supremacy of
reason&mdash;which clearly betrayed his intention of breaking the thraldom of
authority&mdash;that insured his condemnation. It was impossible to restrict
the rising discussions within their proper sphere, or to keep them from
the perilous ground of ecclesiastical history. <span class="side">The book "Sic et Non."</span>
Abelard in his work entitled "Sic et Non," sets forth the contradictory opinions of the
fathers, and exhibits their discord and strifes on great doctrinal
points, thereby insinuating how little of unity there was in the Church.
It was a work suggesting a great deal more than it actually stated, and
was inevitably calculated to draw down upon its author the indignation of
those whose interests it touched.</p>

<p><span class="side">Scholastic philosophy, rise of. </span>Out of the discussions attending these events sprang the celebrated
doctrines of Nominalism and Realism, though the terms themselves seem not
to have been introduced till the end of the twelfth century. The Realists
thought that the general types of things had a real existence; the
Nominalists, that they were merely a mental abstraction expressed by a
word. It was therefore the Old Greek dispute revived. <span class="side">Nominalism and Realism.</span>
Of the Nominalists, Roscelin of Compiègne, a
 little before <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1100, was the first
distinguished advocate; his materializing views, as might <span class="pag">[12]</span> be <a id="expected12"></a>expected,
drawing upon him the reproof of the Church. In this contest, Anselm, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to harmonize reason in subordination
to faith, and again, by his example, demonstrated the necessity of
submitting all such questions to the decision of the human intellect.</p>



<p>The development of scholastic philosophy, which dates from the time of
Erigena, was accelerated by two distinct causes: the dreadful
materialization into which, in Europe, all sacred things had fallen, and
the illustrious example of the Mohammedans, who already, by their
physical inquiries, had commenced a career destined to end in brilliant
results. <span class="side">The Arabs in Spain promote these discussions.</span>
The Spanish universities were filled with ecclesiastics from
many parts of Europe. Peter the Venerable, the friend and protector of
Abelard, who had spent much time in Cordova, and not only spoke Arabic
fluently, but actually translated the Koran into Latin, mentions that, on
his first arrival in Spain, he found several learned men, even from
England, studying astronomy. The reconciliation of many of the dogmas of
authority with common sense was impossible for men of understanding.
Could the clear intellect of such a statesman as Hildebrand be for a
moment disgraced by accepting the received view of a doctrine like that
of transubstantiation? His great difficulty was to reconcile what had
been rendered orthodox by the authority of the Church with the
suggestions of reason, or even with that reverence for holy things which
is in the heart of every intelligent man. In such sentiments, we find an
explanation of the lenient dealings of that stern ecclesiastic with the
heretic Berengar. He saw that it was utterly impossible to offer any
defence of many of the materialized dogmas of the age, but then those
dogmas had been put forth as absolute truth by the Church. <span class="side">Rise of Scholastic Theology. </span>
Things had come to the point at which reason and theology must diverge; yet the
Italian statesmen did not accept this issue without an additional
attempt, and, under their permission, Scholastic Theology, which
originated in the scholastic philosophy of Erigena and his followers,
sought, in the strange union of the Holy Scriptures, the <span class="pag">[13]</span> Aristotelian
<a id="Philosophy13"></a>Philosophy, and Pantheism, to construct a scientific basis for
Christianity. Heresy was to be combated with the weapons of the heretics,
and a co-ordination of authority and reason effected. Under such auspices
scholastic philosophy pervaded the schools, giving to some of them, as
the University of Paris, a fictitious reputation, and leading to the
foundation of others in other cities. It answered the object of its
politic promoters in a double way, for it raised around the orthodox
theology an immense and impenetrable bulwark of what seemed to be
profound learning, and also diverted the awakening mind of Western Europe
to occupations which, if profitless, were yet exciting, and without
danger to the existing state of things. In that manner was put off for a
time the inevitable day in which philosophy and theology were to be
brought into mortal conflict with each other. <span class="side">Its advantages in the existing state of the Church.</span>
It was doubtless seen by Hildebrand and his followers
that, though Berengar had set the example of
protesting against the principle that the decision of a majority of
voters in a council or other collective body should ever be received as
ascertaining absolute truth, yet so great was the uncertainty of the
principles on which the scholastic philosophy was founded, so
undetermined its mental exercise, so ineffectual the results to which it
could attain, that it was unlikely for a long time to disturb the unity
of doctrine in the Church. While men were reasoning round and round again
in the same vicious circle without finding any escape, and indeed without
seeking any, delighted with the dexterity of their movements, but never
considering whether they were making any real advance, it was unnecessary
to anticipate inconvenience from their progress.</p>

<p><span class="side">The philosophical dilemma of the Church.</span>Here was the difficulty. The decisions of the Church were asserted to be
infallible and irrevocable; her philosophy, if such it can be called&mdash;as
must be the case with any philosophy reposing upon a final revelation
from God&mdash;was stationary. But the awakening mind of the West was
displaying, in an unmistakable way, its propensity to advance. As one who
rides an unruly horse will <span class="pag">[14]</span> sometimes <a id="divert14"></a>divert him from a career which
could not be checked by main force by reining him round and round, and
thereby exhausting his spirit and strength, and keeping him in a narrow
space, so the wanton efforts of the mind may be guided, if they cannot be
checked. These principles of policy answered their object for a time,
until metaphysical were changed for physical discussions. Then it became
impossible to divert the onward movement, and on the first great question
arising&mdash;that of the figure and place of the earth&mdash;a question dangerous
to the last degree, since it inferentially included the determination of
the position of man in the universe, theology suffered an irretrievable
defeat. Between her and philosophy there was thenceforth no other issue
than a mortal duel.</p>



<p><span class="side">Course of Scholasticism.</span>Though Erigena is the true founder of Scholasticism, Roscelin, already
mentioned as renewing the question of Platonic Universals, has been
considered by some to be entitled to that distinction. After him, William
of Champeaux opened a school of logic in Paris, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1109, and from that
time the University made it a prominent study. On the rise of the
mendicant orders, Scholasticism received a great impulse, perhaps, as has
been affirmed, because its disputations suited their illiterate state;
Thomas Aquinas, the Dominican, and Duns Scotus, the Franciscan, founding
rival schools, which wrangled for three centuries. In Italy,
Scholasticism never prevailed as it did in France and elsewhere, and at
last it died away, its uselessness, save in the political result before
mentioned, having been detected.</p>


<p><span class="side">Reaction in the papacy against these pressures.</span>
The middle of the eleventh century ushers in an epoch for the papacy and
for Europe. It is marked by an attempt at a moral reformation in the
Church&mdash;by a struggle for securing for the papacy independence both of
the Emperors of Germany and of the neighbouring Italian nobles&mdash;thus far
the pope being the mere officer of the emperor, and often the creature of
the surrounding nobility&mdash;by the conversion of the temporalities of the
Church, heretofore indirect, into absolute possessions, by securing
territories given "to the Church, the blessed Peter, and the <span class="pag">[15]</span> Roman
<a id="republic15"></a>republic" to the first of these beneficiaries, excluding the last.
<span class="side">Preparation for a concentration of the papal power.</span>
As events proceeded, these minor affairs converged, and out of their union
arose the great conflict of the imperial and papal powers for supremacy.
The same policy which had succeeded in depriving the Roman people of any
voice in appointments of popes&mdash;which had secularized the Church in
Italy, for a while seized all the material resources of Europe through
the device of the Crusades, and nearly established a papal autocracy in
all Europe. These political events demand from us notice, since from them
arose intellectual consequences of the utmost importance.</p>


<p>The second Lateran Council, under Nicolas&nbsp;II., accomplished the result of
vesting the elective power for the papacy in the cardinals. That was a
great revolution. It was this council which gave to Berengar his choice
between death and recantation. <span class="side">Three parties in Italy.</span>
There were at this period three powers
engaged in Italy&mdash;the Imperial, the Church party, and the Italian nobles.
For the sake of holding the last in check&mdash;since it was the nearest, it
required the most unremitting attention&mdash;Hildebrand had advised the popes
who were his immediate predecessors to use the Normans, who were settled
in the south of the peninsula, by whom the lands of the nobles were
devastated. Thus the difficulties of their position led the popes to a
repetition of their ancient policy; and as they had, in old times, sought
the protection of the Frankish kings, so now they sought that of the
Normans. <span class="side">Hildebrand becomes pope.</span>
But in the midst of the dissensions and tumults of the times, a
great man was emerging&mdash;Hildebrand, who, with almost superhuman
self-denial, again and again abstained from making himself pope. On the
death of Alexander&nbsp;II. his opportunity came, and, with acceptable force,
he was raised to that dignity, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1073.</p>


<p><span class="side">Hildebrand resolves on a reform.</span>Scarcely  was Hildebrand Pope Gregory&nbsp;VII. when he vigorously proceeded to
carry into effect the policy he had been preparing during the
pontificates of his predecessors. In many respects the times were
propitious. The blameless lives of the German popes had cast a veil of
oblivion over the abominations of their Italian predecessors. <span class="pag">[16]</span> Hildebrand
<a id="addressed16"></a>addressed himself to tear out every vestige of simony and concubinage
with a remorseless hand. That task must be finished before he could hope
to accomplish his grand project of an ecclesiastical autocracy in Europe,
with the pope at its head, and the clergy, both in their persons and
property, independent of the civil power. <span class="side">Necessity of celibacy of the clergy.</span>
It was plain that, apart from
all moral considerations, the supremacy of Rome in such a system
altogether turned on the celibacy of the clergy. If marriage was
permitted to the ecclesiastic, what was to prevent him from handing down,
as an hereditary possession, the wealth and dignities he had obtained. In
such a state of things, the central government at Rome necessarily stood
at every disadvantage against the local interests of an individual, and
still more so if many individuals should combine together to promote, in
common, similar interests. But very different would it be if promotion
must be looked for from Rome&mdash;very different as regards the hold upon
public sentiment, if such a descent from father to son was absolutely
prevented, and a career fairly opened to all, irrespective of their
station in life. To the Church it was to the last degree important that a
man should derive his advancement from her, not from his ancestor. In the
trials to which she was perpetually exposed, there could be no doubt that
by such persons her interests would be best served.</p>


<p><span class="side">It is enforced. </span>In these circumstances Gregory&nbsp;VII. took his course. The synod held at
Rome in the first year of his pontificate denounced the marriage of the
clergy, enforcing its decree by the doctrine that the efficacy of the
sacraments altogether depended on their being administered by hands
sinless in that respect, and made all communicants partners in the
pastoral crime. <span class="side">The pope seeks the friendship of the Normans.</span>
With a provident foresight of the coming opposition, he
carried out the policy he had taught his predecessors of conciliating the
Normans in the south of Italy, though he did not hesitate to resist them,
by the aid of the Countess Matilda, when they dared to touch the
possessions of the Church. It was for the sake of this that the Norman
invasion of England under William the Conqueror had already <span class="pag">[17]</span> been
<a id="approved17"></a>approved of, a consecrated standard and a ring containing a hair from the
head of St. Peter sent him, and permission given for the replacement of
Saxon bishops and other dignitaries by Normans. It was not forgotten how
great had been the gains to the papacy, three centuries before, by
changing the dynasty of the Franks; and thus the policy of an Italian
town gave a permanent impress to the history of England. Hildebrand
foresaw that the sword of the Italian-Norman would be wanted to carry out
his projected ends. He did not hesitate to authorize the overthrow of a
Saxon dynasty by the French-Norman, that he might be more sure of the
fidelity of that sword. Without the countenance of the pope, the Norman
could never have consolidated his power, nor even held his ground in
England.</p>

<p><span class="side">The conflict concerning investitures.</span>From these movements of the papacy sprang the conflict with the Emperors
of Germany respecting investitures. The Bishop of Milan&mdash;who, it appears,
had perjured himself in the quarrel respecting concubinage&mdash;had been
excommunicated by Alexander&nbsp;II. The imperial council appointed as his
successor one Godfrey; the pope had nominated Atto. Hereupon Alexander
had summoned the emperor to appear before him on a charge of simony, and
granting investitures without his approbation. While the matter was yet
in abeyance, Alexander died; but Gregory took up the contest. A synod he
had assembled ordered that, if any one should accept investiture from a
layman, both the giver and receiver should be excommunicated. The
pretence against lay-investiture was that it was a usurpation of a papal
right, and that it led to the appointment of evil and ignorant men; the
reality was a determination to extend papal power, by making Rome the
fountain of emolument. Gregory, by his movements, had thus brought upon
himself three antagonists&mdash;the imperial power, the Italian nobles, and
the married clergy. The latter, unscrupulous and exasperated, met him
with his own weapons, not hesitating to calumniate his friendship with
the Countess Matilda. It was also suspected that they were connected with
the outrage perpetrated by the nobles that took place in Rome.
<span class="side"> Outrage on Hildebrand.</span>
On Christmas <span class="pag">[18]</span> night, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1075, <a id="in18"></a>in the midst of a violent rain, while the
pope was administering the communion, a band of soldiers burst into the
church, seized Gregory at the altar, stripped and wounded him, and,
haling him on horseback behind one of the soldiers, carried him off to a
stronghold, from which he was rescued by the populace. But, without
wavering for a moment, the undaunted pontiff pressed on his conflict with
the imperial power, summoning Henry to Rome to account for his
delinquencies, and threatening his excommunication if he should not
appear before an appointed day. In haste, under the auspices of the king,
a synod was assembled at Worms; charges against the pope of licentious
life, bribery, necromancy, simony, murder, atheism, were introduced and
sentence of deposition pronounced against him. On his side, Gregory
assembled the third Lateran Council, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1076, placed King Henry under
interdict, absolved his subjects from allegiance, and deposed him.


<span class="side">He defines the position of the Church,</span>

A series of constitutions, clearly defining the new bases of the papal
system, was published. They were to the following effect: "That the Roman
pontiff can alone be called universal; that he alone has a right to
depose bishops; that his legates have a right to preside over all bishops
in a general council; that he can depose absent prelates; that he alone
has a right to use imperial ornaments; that princes are bound to kiss his
feet, and his only; that he has a right to depose emperors; that no synod
or council summoned without his commission can be called general; that no
book can be called canonical without his authority; that his sentence can
be annulled by none, but that he may annul the decrees of all; that the
Roman Church has been, is, and will continue to be infallible; that
whoever dissents from it ceases to be a catholic Christian, and that
subjects may be absolved from their allegiance to wicked princes." The
power that could assert such resolutions was near its culmination.</p>

<p>And now was manifest the superiority of the spiritual over the temporal
power. The quarrel with Henry went on, and, after a hard struggle and
many intrigues to draw the Normans over to him, that monarch was
compelled <span class="pag">[19]</span> to <a id="submit19"></a>submit, and in the depth of winter to cross the snowy Alps,
under circumstances of unparalleled hardship, to seek absolution from his
adversary.
<span class="side"> and overcomes the King of Germany.</span>
 Then ensued the scene at Canosa&mdash;a penitent in white raiment
standing in the dreary snow of three winter days, January 1077, cold and
fasting at the gate, seeking pardon and reconciliation of the inexorable
pontiff; that penitent was the King of Germany. Then ensued the dramatic
scene at the sacrament, in which the gray-haired pontiff called upon
Heaven to strike him dead on the spot if he were not innocent of the
crimes of which he had been accused, and dared the guilty monarch to do
the same.</p>


<p><span class="side">Conclusions from these events.</span>Whoever will reflect on these interesting events cannot fail to discern
two important conclusions. The tone of thought throughout Europe had
changed within the last three ages; ideas were entertained, doctrines
originated or controverted, a policy conceived and attempted altogether
in advance of the old times. Intellect, both among the clergy and the
laity, had undergone a great development. But the peculiar character of
the papal power is also ascertained&mdash;that it is worldly, and the result
of the policy of man. The outrage on Hildebrand shows how that power had
diminished at its centre, but the victory over Henry that it maintained
its strength at a distance. Natural forces diminish as the distance
increases; this unnatural force displayed an opposite property.</p>


<p><span class="side">Culmination of the ecclesiastical power.</span>Gregory had carried his point. He had not only beaten back the Northern
attack, but had established the supremacy of the ecclesiastical over the
temporal power, and that point, with inflexible resolution, he
maintained, though in its consequences it cost Germany a civil war. But,
while he was thus unyielding in his temporal policy, there is reason to
suppose that he was not without misgivings in his theological belief. In
the war between Henry and his rival Rodolph, Gregory was compelled by
policy to be at first neutral. He occupied himself with the Eucharistic
controversy.
<span class="side"> Friendship of Hildebrand and Berengar. </span>
This was at the time that he was associated with Berengar,
who lived with him for a year. Nor did the pope think it unworthy of
himself to put <span class="pag">[20]</span> forth, <a id="in20"></a>in excuse of the heretic, a vision, in which the
Virgin Mary had asserted the orthodoxy of Berengar; but, as his quarrel
with King Henry went on to new excommunications and depositions, a synod
of bishops presumed to condemn him as a partisan of Berengar and a
necromancer. On the election of Gilbert of Ravenna as antipope, Gregory,
without hesitation, pushed his principles to their consequences,
denouncing kingship as a wicked and diabolical usurpation, an infraction
of the equal rights of man.
<span class="side">The German contest resumed.</span>
Hereupon Henry determined to destroy him or
to be destroyed; and descending again into Italy, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1081, for three
successive years laid siege to Rome. In vain the amorous Matilda, with
more than the devotion of an ally, endeavoured to succour her beleaguered
friend. The city surrendered to Henry at Christmas, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1084. With his
antipope he entered it, receiving from his hands the imperial crown. The
Norman allies of Hildebrand at last approached in strength. The emperor
was compelled to retreat. A feeble attempt to hold the city was made. The
Normans took it by surprise, and released Gregory from his imprisonment
in the Castle of St. Angelo. An awful scene ensued. Some conflicts
between the citizens and the Normans occurred; a battle in the streets
was the consequence, and Rome was pillaged, sacked, and fired. Streets,
churches, palaces, were left a heap of smoking ashes. The people by
thousands were massacred.
<span class="side"> The Mohammedans support Hildebrand. </span>
 The Saracens, of whom there were multitudes in
the Norman army, were in the Eternal City at last, and, horrible to be
said, were there as the hired supporters of the Vicar of Christ. Matrons,
nuns, young women, were defiled. Crowds of men, women, and children were
carried off and sold as slaves.

<span class="side">Sack of Rome, and death of the pope.</span>

It was the treatment of a city taken by
storm. In consternation, the pontiff with his infidel deliverers retired
from the ruined capital to Salerno, and there he died, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1085.</p>



<p><span class="side">The Crusades. </span>He had been dead ten years, when a policy was entered upon by the papacy
which imparted to it more power than all the exertions of Gregory. The
Crusades were instituted by a French pope, Urban&nbsp;II. Unpopular in Italy,
perhaps by reason of his foreign <span class="pag">[21]</span> birth, <a id="he21"></a>he aroused his native country
for the recovery of the Holy Land. He began his career in a manner not
now unusual, interfering in a quarrel between Philip of France and his
wife, taking the part of the latter, as experience had shown it was
always advisable for a pope to do. Soon, however, he devoted his
attention to something more important than these matrimonial broils. It
seems that a European crusade was first distinctly conceived of and its
value most completely comprehended by Gerbert, to whom, doubtless, his
Mohammedan experiences had suggested it. In the first year of his
pontificate, he wrote an epistle, in the name of the Church of Jerusalem,
to the Church throughout the world, exhorting Christian soldiers to come
to her relief either with arms or money. It had been subsequently
contemplated by Gregory&nbsp;VII. For many years, pilgrimages to Palestine had
been on the increase; a very lucrative export trade in relics from that
country had arisen; crowds from all parts of Europe had of late made
their way to Jerusalem, for the singular purpose of being present at the
great assize which the Scriptures were supposed to prophesy would soon
take place in the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The Mohammedans had inflicted on
these pious persons much maltreatment, being unable to comprehend the
purport of their extraordinary journey, and probably perceiving a
necessity of putting some restriction upon the influx of such countless
multitudes.
<span class="side">The Council of Clermont authorizes a crusade.</span>
Peter the Hermit, who had witnessed the barbarities to which
his Christian brethren were exposed, and the abominations of the holy
places now in the hands of the infidel, roused Europe, by his preaching,
to a frantic state; and Urban, at the Council of Clermont, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1095,
gave authority to the Holy War. "It is the will of God," was the
unanimous shout of the council and the populace. The periodical shower of
shooting stars was seen with remarkable brilliancy on April 25th, and
mistaken by the council for a celestial monition that the Christians must
precipitate themselves in like manner on the East. From this incident we
may perceive how little there was of inspiration in these blundering and
violent ecclesiastical assemblages; the moment that they can be brought
to a scientific test <span class="pag">[22]</span> their <a id="true22"></a>true nature is detected. As a preliminary
exercise, a ferocious persecution of the Jews of France had burst forth,
and the blood and tortures of multitudes offered a tardy expiation for
the crimes that their ancestors had committed at the Crucifixion in
Jerusalem, more than a thousand years previously.</p>



<p><span class="side">The first crusade.</span>It does not fall within my plan to give a detailed description of the
Crusades. It is enough to say that, though the clergy had promised the
protection of God to every one who would thus come to his assistance&mdash;an
ample reward for their pious work in this life, and the happiness of
heaven in the next&mdash;Urban's crusade failed not only disastrously, but
hideously, so far as the ignorant rabbles, under Peter the Hermit and
Walter the Penniless, were concerned. Nevertheless, under the
better-organized expeditions that soon followed, Jerusalem was captured,
July 15th, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1099. The long and ghastly line of bones whitening the
road through Hungary to the East showed how different a thing it was for
a peaceable and solitary pilgrim, with his staff, and wallet, and
scallop-shell, to beg his way, and a disorderly rabble of thousands upon
thousands to rush forward without any subordination, any organization,
trusting only to the providence of God. The van of the Crusades consisted
of two hundred and seventy-five thousand men, accompanied by eight
horses, and preceded by a goat and a goose, into which some one had told
them that the Holy Ghost had entered. Driven to madness by disappointment
and famine&mdash;expecting, in their ignorance, that every town they came to
must be Jerusalem&mdash;in their extremity they laid hands on whatever they
could. Their track was marked by robbery, bloodshed, and fire. In the
first crusade more than half a million of men died. It was far more
disastrous than the Moscow retreat.</p>



<p><span class="side">Storming of Jerusalem.</span>But still, in a military sense, the first crusade accomplished its
object. The capture of Jerusalem, as might be expected under such
circumstances, was attended by the perpetration of atrocities almost
beyond belief. What a contrast to the conduct of the Arabs! When the
Khalif Omar took Jerusalem, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;637, he rode into the city by the side
of the <span class="pag">[23]</span> Patriarch <a id="Sophronius23"></a>Sophronius, conversing with him on its antiquities. At
the hour of prayer, he declined to perform his devotions in the Church of
the Resurrection, in which he chanced to be, but prayed on the steps of
the Church of Constantine; "for," said he to the patriarch, "had I done
so, the Musselmen in a future age would have infringed the treaty, under
colour of imitating my example." But, in the capture by the Crusaders,
the brains of young children were dashed out against the walls; infants
were thrown over the battlements; every woman that could be seized was
violated; men were roasted at fires; some were ripped open, to see if
they had swallowed gold; the Jews were driven into their synagogue, and
there burnt; a massacre of nearly 70,000 persons took place; and the
pope's legate was seen "partaking in the triumph."</p>



<p><span class="side">Political results of the Crusades. </span>It had been expected by the politicians who first projected these wars
that they would heal the divisions of the Latin and Greek churches, and
give birth to a European republic, under the spiritual presidency of the
pope. In these respects they proved a failure. It does not appear that
the popes themselves personally had ever any living faith in the result.
Not one of them ever joined a crusade; and the Church, as a corporation,
took care to embark very little money in these undertakings. But, though
they did not answer to the original intention, they gave, in an indirect
way, a wonderful stimulus to the papal power.
<span class="side">Give to Rome the control of men and money in Europe.</span>
 Under the plausible pretences offered by them, the
 pope obtained control over the person of
every Christian man from the highest to the lowest. The cross once taken,
all civil control over the Crusader ceased&mdash;he became the man of the
Church. Under those pretences, also, a right was imperceptibly acquired
of raising revenue in all parts of Europe; even the clergy might be
assessed. A drain was thus established on the resources of distant
nations for an object which no man dared to gainsay; if he adventured on
any such thing, he must encounter the odium of an infidel&mdash;an atheist. A
steady stream of money flowed into Italy. Nor was it alone by this
taxation of every Christian nation without permission of its
government&mdash;this empire within <span class="pag">[24]</span> every <a id="empire24"></a>empire&mdash;immense wealth accrued to
the projectors, while the infatuation could be kept up, by the diminished
rate at which land could be obtained. Domains were thrown into the
market; there were few purchasers except the Church. Immense domains were
also given away by weak-minded sinners, and those on the point of death,
for the salvation of their souls. Thus, all things considered, the effect
of the Crusades, though not precisely that which was expected, was of
singular advantage to the Church, giving it a commanding strength it had
never before possessed.</p>

<p>In  their resistance to the German attack the popes never hesitated at any
means. They prompted Prince Henry to revolt against their great
antagonist, his father; they intervened, not to rebuke, but to abet him,
when he threw his father into prison and deprived him of the necessaries
of life. They carried their vengeance beyond the grave. When the aged
emperor, broken in heart, escaped from their torment, and was honourably
buried by the Bishop of Liège, that prelate was forthwith excommunicated
and compelled to disinter the corpse. But crimes like these, against
which human nature revolts, meet with retribution.
<span class="side">Resistance of Henry&nbsp;V.</span>
This same Prince Henry, becoming Henry&nbsp;V.,
was forced by circumstances to resume his
father's quarrel, and to refuse to yield his right of granting
investitures. He marched upon Rome, and at the point of the sword
compelled his adversary, Pope Paschal&nbsp;II., to surrender all the
possessions and royalties of the Church&mdash;compelled him to crown him
emperor&mdash;not, however, until the pontiff had been subjected to the
ignominy of imprisonment, and brought into condemnation among his own
party.</p>



<p><span class="side">Bernard of Clairvaux stimulates the second crusade.</span>Things  seemed to be going to ruin in Rome, and such must inevitably have
been the issue, had not an extraneous influence arisen in Bernard of
Clairvaux, to whom Europe learned to look up as the beater down of
heresies, theological and political. He had been a pupil of William of
Champeaux, the vanquished rival of Abelard, and Abelard he hated with a
religious and personal hate. He was a wonder-worker. He excommunicated
the flies which <span class="pag">[25]</span> infested a <a id="church25"></a>church&mdash;they all fell down dead and were
swept out by the basketful. He has been described as "the mellifluous
doctor, whose works are not scientific, but full of unction." He could
not tolerate the principle at the basis of Abelard's philosophy&mdash;the
assertion of the supremacy of reason. Of Arnold of Brescia&mdash;who carried
that principle to its political consequences, and declared that the
riches and power of the clergy were inconsistent with their
profession&mdash;he was the accuser and punisher.
<span class="side">Its failure.</span>
Bernard preached a new
crusade, authenticating his power by miracles, affirmed to be not
inferior to those of our Saviour; promising to him who should slay an
unbeliever happiness in this life and Paradise in the life to come.
This second crusade was conducted by kings, and included fanatic ladies,
dressed in the armour of men; but it ended in ruin.</p>


<p>It was reserved for the only Englishman who ever attained to the papacy
to visit Rome with the punishment she had so often inflicted upon others.
Nicolas Breakspear&mdash;Adrian&nbsp;IV.&mdash;put the Eternal City under interdict,
thereby ending the republic which the partisans of Arnold of Brescia had
set up. But in this he was greatly aided by a change of sentiment in many
of the inhabitants of Rome, who had found to their cost that it was more
profitable for their city to be the centre of Christianity than the seat
of a phantom republic.
<span class="side">Murder of Arnold of Brescia.</span>
As an equivalent for his coronation by Adrian,
Frederick Barbarossa agreed to surrender to the Church Arnold of Brescia.
With indecent haste, the moment she had obtained possession of her
arch-enemy she put him to death&mdash;not delivering him over to the secular
arm, as the custom had been, but murdering him with her own hand. Seven
centuries have elapsed, and the blood of Arnold is still crying from the
ground for retribution. Notwithstanding a new&mdash;the third&mdash;crusade, things
went from bad to worse in the Holy Land. Saladin had retaken Jerusalem,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1187. Barbarossa was drowned in a river in Pisidia. Richard of
England was treacherously imprisoned; nor did the pope interfere for this
brave soldier of the Cross.
<span class="side"> Birth of Frederick&nbsp;II.</span>
 In the meantime, the Emperors of Germany had
acquired Sicily <span class="pag">[26]</span> by <a id="marriage26"></a>marriage&mdash;an incident destined to be of no little
importance in the history of Europe; for, on the death of the Emperor
Henry&nbsp;VI. at Messina, his son Frederick, an infant not two years old, was
left to be brought up in that island. What the consequences were we shall
soon see.</p>



<p><span class="side">Review of the preceding events.</span>If we  review the events related in this chapter, we find that the
idolatry and immorality into which Rome had fallen had become connected
with material interests sufficiently powerful to ensure their
perpetuation; that converted Germany insisted on a reform, and therefore
made a moral attack on the Italian system, attempting to carry it into
effect by civil force. This attack was, properly speaking, purely moral,
the intellectual element accompanying it being derived from Western or
Arabian influences, as will be shown in the next chapter; and, in its
resistance to this, the papacy was not only successful, but actually was
able to retaliate, overthrowing the Emperors of Germany, and being even
on the point of establishing a European autocracy, with the pope at its
head. It was in these events that the Reformation began, though
circumstances intervened to postpone its completion to the era of Luther.
Henceforth we see more and more plainly the attitude in which the papacy,
through its material interests, was compelled to stand, as resisting all
intellectual advancement. Our subject has therefore here to be left
unfinished until we shall have described the Mohammedan influences making
pressures on the West and the East.</p>

<p><span class="side">The pressure from the West upon Rome.</span> A  <span class="pag">[27]</span>pressure upon the Italian system had meantime been arising in the West.
It was due to the presence of the Arabs in Spain. It is necessary,
therefore, to relate the circumstances of their invasion and conquest of
that country, and to compare their social and intellectual condition with
the contemporary state of Christendom.</p>

<p><span class="side">Barbarism of Europe.</span>From the barbarism of the native people of Europe, who could scarcely be
said to have emerged from the savage state, unclean in person, benighted
in mind, inhabiting huts in which it was a mark of wealth if there were
bulrushes on the floor and straw mats against the wall; miserably fed on
beans, vetches, roots, and even the bark of trees; clad in garments of
untanned skin, or at the best of leather&mdash;perennial in durability, but
not conducive to personal purity&mdash;a state in which the pomp of <span class="pag">[28]</span> royalty
<a id="was28"></a>was sufficiently and satisfactorily manifested in the equipage of the
sovereign, an ox-cart, drawn by not less than two yokes of cattle,
quickened in their movements by the goads of pedestrian serfs, whose legs
were wrapped in wisps of straw; from a people, devout believers in all
the wild fictions of shrine-miracles and preposterous relics; from the
degradation of a base theology, and from the disputes of ambitious
ecclesiastics for power, it is pleasant to turn to the south-west corner
of the continent, where, under auspices of a very different kind, the
irradiations of light were to break forth. The crescent in the West was
soon to pass eastward to its full.</p>

<p>But I must retrace my steps through four centuries, and resume the
description of the Arabian movement after the subjugation of Africa, as
related in the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31345/31345-h/31345-h.htm#CHAPTER_XI">former volume, Chapter&nbsp;XI.</a></p>



<p><span class="side">Arab invasion of Spain.</span> Those were the circumstances of the Arab conquest of Spain. In that
country the Arian Creed had been supplanted by the orthodox, and the
customary persecutions had set in. From the time of the Emperor Hadrian,
who had transported 50,000 Jewish families into Spain, that race had
greatly increased, and, as might be expected, had received no mercy at
the hands of the orthodox. Ninety thousand individuals had recently
suffered compulsory baptism, and so had been brought under the atrocious
Catholic law that whoever has been baptized shall be compelled to
continue the observances of the Church. The Gothic monarchy was elective,
and Roderic had succeeded to the throne, to the prejudice of the heirs of
his predecessor. Though a very brave soldier, he was a luxurious and
licentious man. It was the custom of the Goths to send their children to
Toledo to be educated, and, under these circumstances, a young girl of
extraordinary beauty, the daughter of Count Julian, governor of Ceuta in
Africa, was residing there. King Roderic fell passionately in love with
her, and, being unable to overcome her virtuous resolution by persuasion,
resorted to violence. The girl found means to inform her father of what
had occurred. "By the living God!" exclaimed the count, in a paroxysm of
rage, "I will be revenged." But, dissembling his wrath, he crossed over
into Spain, had <span class="pag">[29]</span> an <a id="understanding29"></a>understanding with Oppas, the Archbishop of Toledo,
and other disaffected ecclesiastics, and, under specious pretences,
lulled the suspicions of Roderic, and brought his daughter away. And now
he opened communications with the Emir Musa, prevailing upon him to
attempt the conquest of the country, and offering that he himself would
take the lead. The conditions were settled between them, and the consent
of the khalif to the expedition obtained.
<span class="side"> Its conquest.</span>
 Tarik, a lieutenant of the
emir, was sent across the Straits with the van of the army. He landed on
the rock called, in memory of his name, Gibraltar, April, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;711. In
the battle that ensued, a part of Roderic's troops, together with the
Archbishop of Toledo, consummated their treasonable compact, and deserted
to the Arabs; the rest were panic-stricken. In the rout, Roderic himself
was drowned in the waters of the Guadalquivir.</p>

<p>Tarik now proceeded rapidly northward, and was soon joined by his
superior, the Emir Musa, who was not, perhaps, without jealousy at his
success. As the Arab historians say, the Almighty delivered the idolators
into their hand, and gave them one victory after another. As the towns
successively fell, they left them in charge of the Jews, to whose revenge
the conquest was largely due, and who could be thoroughly trusted; nor
did they pause in their march until they had passed the French frontier
and reached the Rhone. It was the intention of Musa to cross the European
continent to Constantinople, subjugating the Frank, German, and Italian
barbarians by the way. At this time it seemed impossible that France
could escape the fate of Spain; and if she fell, the threat of Musa would
inevitably have come to pass, that he would preach the Unity of God in
the Vatican. But a quarrel had arisen between him and Tarik, who had been
imprisoned and even scourged. The friends of the latter, however, did not
fail him at the court of Damascus. An envoy from the Khalif Alwalid
appeared, ordering Musa to desist from his enterprise, to return to
Syria, and exonerate himself of the things laid to his charge. But Musa
bribed the envoy to let him advance. Hereupon the angry khalif dispatched
a second messenger, who, in face of the Moslems and Christians,
audaciously arrested him, at the head of <span class="pag">[30]</span> his <a id="troops30"></a>troops, by the bridle of
his horse. The conqueror of Spain was compelled to return. He was cast
into prison, fined 200,000 pieces of gold, publicly whipped, and his life
with difficulty spared. As is related of Belisarius, Musa was driven as a
beggar to solicit charity, and the Saracen conqueror of Spain ended his
days in grief and absolute want.</p>



<p><span class="side">Arrest of Mohammedanism in Western Europe.</span>The dissensions among the Arabs, far more than the sword of Charles
Martel, prevented the Mohammedanization of France. Their historians admit
the great check received at the battle of Tours, in which Abderrahman was
killed; they call that field the Place of the Martyrs; but their accounts
by no means correspond to the relations of the Christian authors, who
affirm that 375,000 Mohammedans fell, and only 1500 Christians. The
defeat was not so disastrous but that in a few months they were able to
resume their advance, and their progress was arrested only by renewed
dissensions among themselves&mdash;dissensions not alone among the leaders in
Spain, but also more serious ones of aspirants for the khalifate in Asia.
On the overthrow of the Ommiade house, Abderrahman, one of that family,
escaped to Spain, which repaid the patronage of its conquest by
acknowledging him as its sovereign. He made Cordova the seat of his
government. Neither he nor his immediate successors took any other title
than that of Emir, out of respect to the khalif, who resided at Bagdad,
the metropolis of Islam, though they maintained a rivalry with him in the
patronage of letters and science. Abderrahman himself strengthened his
power by an alliance with Charlemagne.</p>


<p><span class="side">Civilization and splendour of the Spanish Arabs.</span>Scarcely  had the Arabs become firmly settled in Spain when they commenced
a brilliant career. Adopting what had now become the established policy
of the Commanders of the Faithful in Asia, the Emirs of Cordova
distinguished themselves as patrons of learning, and set an example of
refinement strongly contrasting with the condition of the native European
princes. Cordova, under their administration, at its highest point of
prosperity, boasted of more than two hundred thousand houses, and more
than a million of inhabitants. After sunset, a man might walk <span class="pag">[31]</span> through <a id="it31"></a>it
in a straight line for ten miles by the light of the public lamps. Seven
hundred years after this time there was not so much as one public lamp in
London. Its streets were solidly paved. In Paris, centuries subsequently,
whoever stepped over his threshold on a rainy day stepped up to his
ankles in mud. Other cities, as Granada, Seville, Toledo, considered
themselves rivals of Cordova. The palaces of the khalifs were
magnificently decorated. Those sovereigns might well look down with
supercilious contempt on the dwellings of the rulers of Germany, France,
and England, which were scarcely better than stables&mdash;chimneyless,
windowless, and with a hole in the roof for the smoke to escape, like the
wigwams of certain Indians. The Spanish Mohammedans had brought with them
all the luxuries and prodigalities of Asia.
<span class="side">Their palaces and gardens. </span>
Their residences stood forth
against the clear blue sky, or were embosomed in woods. They had polished
marble balconies, overhanging orange-gardens; courts with cascades of
water; shady retreats provocative of slumber in the heat of the day;
retiring-rooms vaulted with stained glass, speckled with gold, over which
streams of water were made to gush; the floors and walls were of
exquisite mosaic. Here, a fountain of quicksilver shot up in a glistening
spray, the glittering particles falling with a tranquil sound like fairy
bells; there, apartments into which cool air was drawn from the
flower-gardens, in summer, by means of ventilating towers, and in winter
through earthen pipes, or caleducts, imbedded in the walls&mdash;the
hypocaust, in the vaults below, breathing forth volumes of warm and
perfumed air through these hidden passages. The walls were not covered
with wainscot, but adorned with arabesques, and paintings of agricultural
scenes and views of Paradise. From the ceilings, corniced with fretted
gold, great chandeliers hung, one of which, it is said, was so large that
it contained 1804 lamps. Clusters of frail marble columns surprised the
beholder with the vast weights they bore. In the boudoirs of the sultanas
they were sometimes of verd antique, and incrusted with lapis lazuli. The
furniture was of sandal and citron wood, inlaid with mother-of-pearl,
ivory, silver, or relieved with gold and precious malachite. In orderly
confusion were arranged vases of rock crystal, <span class="pag">[32]</span> Chinese <a id="porcelains32"></a>porcelains, and
tables of exquisite mosaic. The winter apartments were hung with rich
tapestry; the floors were covered with embroidered Persian carpets.
Pillows and couches, of elegant forms, were scattered about the rooms,
perfumed with frankincense. It was the intention of the Saracen
architect, by excluding the view of the external landscape, to
concentrate attention on his work; and since the representation of the
human form was religiously forbidden, and that source of decoration
denied, his imagination ran riot with the complicated arabesques he
introduced, and sought every opportunity of replacing the prohibited
works of art by the trophies and rarities of the garden. For this reason,
the Arabs never produced artists; religion turned them from the
beautiful, and made them soldiers, philosophers, and men of affairs.
Splendid flowers and rare exotics ornamented the courtyards and even the
inner chambers. Great care was taken to make due provision for the
cleanliness, occupation, and amusement of the inmates. Through pipes of
metal, water, both warm and cold, to suit the season of the year, ran
into baths of marble; in niches, where the current of air could be
artificially directed, hung dripping alcarazzas.
<span class="side">Libraries and works of taste.</span>There were
whispering-galleries for the amusement of the women; labyrinths and
marble play-courts for the children; for the master himself, grand
libraries. The Khalif Alhakem's was so large that the catalogue alone
filled forty volumes. He had also apartments for the transcribing,
binding, and ornamenting of books. A taste for caligraphy and the
possession of splendidly-illuminated manuscripts seems to have
anticipated in the khalifs, both of Asia and Spain, the taste for
statuary and paintings among the later popes of Rome.</p>

<p><span class="side">The court of Abderrahman III.</span>Such  were the palace and gardens of Zehra, in which Abderrahman&nbsp;III.
honoured his favourite sultana. The edifice had 1200 columns of Greek,
Italian, Spanish, and African marble. Its hall of audience was incrusted
with gold and pearls. Through the long corridors of its seraglio black
eunuchs silently glided. The ladies of the harem, both wives and
concubines, were the most beautiful that could be found. To that
establishment alone 6300 persons were attached, The <span class="pag">[33]</span> body-guard <a id="of33"></a>of the
sovereign was composed of 12,000 horsemen, whose cimeters and belts were
studded with gold. This was that Abderrahman who, after a glorious reign
of fifty years, sat down to count the number of days of unalloyed
happiness he had experienced, and could only enumerate fourteen. "Oh
man!" exclaimed the plaintive khalif, "put not thy trust in this present
world."</p>


<p><span class="side">Social habits of the Moors.</span>No  nation has ever excelled the Spanish Arabs in the beauty and
costliness of their pleasure-gardens. To them we owe the introduction of
very many of our most valuable cultivated fruits, such as the peach.
Retaining the love of their ancestors for the cooling effect of water in
a hot climate, they spared no pains in the superfluity of fountains,
hydraulic works, and artificial lakes in which fish were raised for the
table. Into such a lake, attached to the palace of Cordova, many loaves
were cast each day to feed the fish. There were also menageries of
foreign animals; aviaries of rare birds; manufactories in which skilled
workmen, obtained from foreign countries, displayed their art in textures
of silk, cotton, linen, and all the miracles of the loom; in jewelry and
filigree-work, with which they ministered to the female pride of the
sultanas and concubines. Under the shade of cypresses cascades
disappeared; among flowering shrubs there were winding walks, bowers of
roses, seats cut out of the rock, and crypt-like grottoes hewn in the
living stone. Nowhere was ornamental gardening better understood; for not
only did the artist try to please the eye as it wandered over the
pleasant gradation of vegetable colour and form&mdash;he also boasted his
success in the gratification of the sense of smell by the studied
succession of perfumes from beds of flowers.</p>


<p><span class="side">Their domestic life.</span>To  these Saracens we are indebted for many of our personal comforts.
Religiously cleanly, it was not possible for them to clothe themselves
according to the fashion of the natives of Europe, in a garment unchanged
till it dropped to pieces of itself, a loathsome mass of vermin, stench,
and rags. No Arab who had been a minister of state, or the associate or
antagonist of a sovereign, would have offered such a spectacle as the
corpse of Thomas à Becket when his haircloth shirt was removed. They
taught us the use of the <span class="pag">[34]</span> often-changed <a id="and34"></a>and often-washed under-garment of
linen or cotton, which still passes among ladies under its old Arabic
name. But to cleanliness they were not unwilling to add ornament.
Especially among women of the higher classes was the love of finery a
passion. Their outer garments were often of silk, embroidered and
decorated with gems and woven gold. So fond were the Moorish women of gay
colours and the lustre of chrysolites, hyacinths, emeralds, and
sapphires, that it was quaintly said that the interior of any public
building in which they were permitted to appear looked like a
flower-meadow in the spring besprinkled with rain.</p>


<p><span class="side">They cultivate literature, music,</span> In the midst of all this luxury, which cannot be regarded by the
historian with disdain, since in the end it produced a most important
result in the south of France, the Spanish khalifs, emulating the example
of their Asiatic compeers, and in this strongly contrasting with the
popes of Rome, were not only the patrons, but the personal cultivators of
all the branches of human learning. One of them was himself the author of
a work on polite literature in not less than fifty volumes; another wrote
a treatise on algebra. When Zaryab the musician came from the East to
Spain, the Khalif Abderrahman rode forth to meet him in honour. The
College of Music in Cordova was sustained by ample government patronage,
and produced many illustrious professors.</p>


<p><span class="side">but disapprove of European mythology.</span>The Arabs never translated into their own tongue the great Greek poets,
though they so sedulously collected and translated the Greek
philosophers. Their religious sentiments and sedate character caused them
to abominate the lewdness of our classical mythology, and to denounce
indignantly any connexion between the licentious, impure Olympian Jove
and the Most High God as an insufferable and unpardonable blasphemy.
Haroun al Raschid had gratified his curiosity by causing Homer to be
translated into Syriac, but he did not adventure on rendering the great
epics into Arabic. Notwithstanding this aversion to our graceful but not
unobjectionable ancient poetry, among them originated the Tensons, or
poetic disputations, carried afterward to perfection among the
Troubadours; from them, also, the Provençals learned to employ jongleurs.
Across the Pyrenees, <span class="pag">[35]</span> literary, <a id="philosophical35"></a>philosophical, and military adventurers
were perpetually passing; and thus the luxury, the taste, and above all,
the chivalrous gallantry and elegant courtesies of Moorish society found
their way from Granada and Cordova to Provence and Languedoc.
<span class="side">The south of France contracts their tastes. </span>
 The French,
and German, and English nobles imbibed the Arab admiration of the horse;
they learned to pride themselves on skilful riding. Hunting and falconry
became their fashionable pastimes; they tried to emulate that Arab skill
which had produced the celebrated breed of Andalusian horses. It was a
scene of grandeur and gallantry; the pastimes were tilts and tournaments.
The refined society of Cordova prided itself in its politeness. A gay
contagion spread from the beautiful Moorish miscreants to their sisters
beyond the mountains; the south of France was full of the witcheries of
female fascinations, and of dancing to the lute and mandolin.
<span class="side">Light literature spreads into Sicily and Italy. </span>
 Even in
Italy and Sicily the love-song became the favourite composition; and out
of these genial but not orthodox beginnings the polite literature of
modern Europe arose. The pleasant epidemic spread by degrees along every
hillside and valley. In monasteries, voices that had vowed celibacy might
be heard carolling stanzas of which St. Jerome would hardly have
approved; there was many a juicy abbot, who could troll forth in jocund
strains, like those of the merry sinners of Malaga and Xeres, the charms
of women and wine, though one was forbidden to the Moslem and one to the
monk. The sedate greybeards of Cordova had already applied to the supreme
judge to have the songs of the Spanish Jew, Abraham Ibn Sahal,
prohibited; for there was not a youth, nor woman, nor child in the city
who could not repeat them by heart. Their immoral tendency was a public
scandal. The light gaiety of Spain was reflected in the coarser habits of
the northern countries. It was an archdeacon of Oxford who some time
afterward sang,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Mihi sit propositum in tabernâ mori,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Vinum sit appositum morientis ori,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ut dicant, cum venerint angelorum chori;</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Deus sit propitius huic potatori,'" etc.</span><br />
</div>

<p> <span class="pag">[36]</span> <a id="Even36"></a>Even as early as the tenth century, persons having a taste for learning
and for elegant amenities found their way into Spain from all adjoining
countries; a practice in subsequent years still more indulged in, when it
became illustrated by the brilliant success of Gerbert, who, as we have
seen, passed from the Infidel University of Cordova to the papacy of
Rome.</p>

<p><span class="side">The Arabian school system.</span>The  khalifs of the West carried out the precepts of Ali, the fourth
successor of Mohammed, in the patronage of literature. They established
libraries in all their chief towns; it is said that not fewer than
seventy were in existence. To every mosque was attached a public school,
in which the children of the poor were taught to read and write, and
instructed in the precepts of the Koran. For those in easier
circumstances there were academies, usually arranged in twenty-five or
thirty apartments, each calculated for accommodating four students; the
academy being presided over by a rector. In Cordova, Granada, and other
great cities, there were universities frequently under the
superintendence of Jews; the Mohammedan maxim being that the real
learning of a man is of more public importance than any particular
religious opinions he may entertain. In this they followed the example of
the Asiatic khalif, Haroun al Raschid, who actually conferred the
superintendence of his schools on John Masué, a Nestorian Christian. The
Mohammedan liberality was in striking contrast with the intolerance of
Europe. Indeed, it may be doubted whether at this time any European
nation is sufficiently advanced to follow such an example. In the
universities some of the professors of polite literature gave lectures on
Arabic classical works; others taught rhetoric or composition, or
mathematics, or astronomy. From these institutions many of the practices
observed in our colleges were derived. They held Commencements, at which
poems were read and orations delivered in presence of the public. They
had also, in addition to these schools of general learning, professional
ones, particularly for medicine.</p>


<p><span class="side">Cultivation of grammar, rhetoric, composition. </span>With a pride perhaps not altogether inexcusable, the Arabians boasted of
their language as being the  <span class="pag">[37]</span>  most <a id="perfect37"></a>perfect spoken by man. Mohammed
himself, when challenged to produce a miracle in proof of the
authenticity of his mission, uniformly pointed to the composition of the
Koran, its unapproachable excellence vindicating its inspiration. The
orthodox Moslems&mdash;the Moslems are those who are submissively resigned to
the Divine will&mdash;are wont to assert that every page of that book is
indeed a conspicuous miracle. It is not then surprising that, in the
Arabian schools, great attention was paid to the study of language, and
that so many celebrated grammarians were produced. By these scholars,
dictionaries, similar to those now in use, were composed; their
copiousness is indicated by the circumstance that one of them consisted
of sixty volumes, the definition of each word being illustrated or
sustained by quotations from Arab authors of acknowledged repute. They
had also lexicons of Greek, Latin, Hebrew; and cyclopedias such as the
Historical Dictionary of Sciences of Mohammed Ibn Abdallah, of Granada.
In their highest civilization and luxury they did not forget the
amusements of their forefathers&mdash;listening to the tale-teller, who never
failed to obtain an audience in the midst of Arab tents. Around the
evening fires in Spain the wandering literati exercised their wonderful
powers of Oriental invention, edifying the eager listeners by such
narrations as those that have descended to us in the Arabian Nights'
Entertainments. The more sober and higher efforts of the educated were,
of course, directed to pulpit eloquence, in conformity with the example
of all the great Oriental khalifs, and sanctified by the practice of the
Prophet himself.
<span class="side">Defects of their literature.</span>
Their poetical productions embraced all the modern minor
forms&mdash;satires, odes, elegies, etc.; but they never produced any work in
the higher walks of poesy, no epic, no tragedy. Perhaps this was due to
their false fashion of valuing the mechanical execution of a work. They
were the authors and introducers of rhyme; and such was the luxuriance
and abundance of their language, that, in some of their longest poems,
the same rhyme is said to have been used alternately from the beginning
to the end. Where such mechanical triumphs were popularly prized, it may
be <a id="supposed38"></a>supposed that the conception and spirit would be indifferent. Even  <span class="pag">[38]</span>
among the Spanish women there were not a few who, like Velada, Ayesha,
Labana, Algasania, achieved reputation in these compositions; and some of
them were daughters of khalifs. And this is the more interesting to us,
since it was from the Provençal poetry, the direct descendant of these
efforts, that European literature arose. Sonnets and romances at last
displaced the grimly-orthodox productions of the wearisome and ignorant
fathers of the Church.</p>

<p>If fiction was prized among the Spanish Arabs, history was held in not
less esteem. Every khalif had his own historian. The instincts of the
race are perpetually peeping out; not only were there historians of the
Commanders of the Faithful, but also of celebrated horses and illustrious
camels. In connexion with history, statistics were cultivated; this
having been, it may be said, a necessary study, from the first enforced
on the Saracen officers in their assessment of tribute on conquered
misbelievers, and subsequently continued as an object of taste.
<span class="side">Their taste for practical science.</span>
It was,
doubtless, a similar necessity, arising from their position, that stamped
such a remarkably practical aspect on the science of the Arabs generally.
Many of their learned men were travellers and voyagers, constantly moving
about for the acquisition or diffusion of knowledge, their acquirements
being a passport to them wherever they went, and a sufficient
introduction to any of the African or Asiatic courts. They were thus
continually brought in contact with men of affairs, soldiers of fortune,
statesmen, and became imbued with much of their practical spirit; and
hence the singularly romantic character which the biographies of many of
these men display, wonderful turns of prosperity, violent deaths. The
scope of their literary labours offers a subject well worthy of
meditation; it contrasts with the contemporary ignorance of Europe. Some
wrote on chronology; some on numismatics; some, now that military
eloquence had become objectless, wrote on pulpit oratory; some on
agriculture and its allied branches, as the art of irrigation. Not one of
the purely mathematical, or mixed, or practical sciences was omitted.
<span class="side"> Their continued inclination to the study of medicine.</span>
 <span class="pag">[39]</span>  <a id="Out39"></a>Out of a list too long for detailed quotation, I may recall a few names.
Assamh, who wrote on topography and statistics, a brave soldier, who was
killed in the invasion of France, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;720; Avicenna, the great physician
and philosopher, who died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1037; Averroes, of Cordova, the chief
commentator on Aristotle, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1198. It was his intention to unite the
doctrines of Aristotle with those of the Koran. To him is imputed the
discovery of spots upon the sun. The leading idea of his philosophy was
the numerical unity of the souls of mankind, though parted among millions
of living individuals. He died at Morocco. Abu Othman wrote on zoology;
Alberuni, on gems&mdash;he had travelled to India to procure information;
Rhazes, Al Abbas, and Al Beithar, on botany&mdash;the latter had been in all
parts of the world for the purpose of obtaining specimens. Ebn Zoar,
better known as Avenzoar, may be looked upon as the authority in Moorish
pharmacy. Pharmacop&oelig;ias were published by the schools, improvements on
the old ones of the Nestorians: to them may be traced the introduction of
many Arabic words, such as syrup, julep, elixir, still used among
apothecaries.
<span class="side"> Relics of the Arab vocabulary. </span>
A competent scholar might furnish not only an interesting,
but valuable book, founded on the remaining relics of the Arab
vocabulary; for, in whatever direction we may look, we meet, in the
various pursuits of peace and war, of letters and of science, Saracenic
vestiges. Our dictionaries tell us that such is the origin of admiral,
alchemy, alcohol, algebra, chemise, cotton, and hundreds of other words.
The Saracens commenced the application of chemistry, both to the theory
and practice of medicine, in the explanation of the functions of the
human body and in the cure of its diseases.
<span class="side">Their medicine and surgery.</span>
 Nor was their surgery behind
their medicine. Albucasis, of Cordova, shrinks not from the performance
of the most formidable operations in his own and in the obstetrical art;
the actual cautery and the knife are used without hesitation. He has left
us ample descriptions of the surgical instruments then employed; and from
him we learn that, in operations on females in which considerations of
delicacy intervened, the services of  <span class="pag">[40]</span>  properly <a id="instructed40"></a>instructed women were
secured. How different was all this from the state of things in Europe;
the Christian peasant, fever-stricken or overtaken by accident, hied to
the nearest saint-shrine and expected a miracle; the Spanish Moor relied
on the prescription or lancet of his physician, or the bandage and knife
of his surgeon.</p>


<p><span class="side">Liberality of the Asiatic khalifs.</span>In mathematics the Arabians acknowledged their indebtedness to two
sources, Greek and Indian, but they greatly improved upon both. The
Asiatic khalifs had made exertions to procure translations of Euclid,
Apollonius, Archimedes, and other Greek geometers. Almaimon, in a letter
to the Emperor Theophilus, expressed his desire to visit Constantinople
if his public duties would have permitted. He requests of him to allow
Leo the mathematician to come to Bagdad to impart to him a portion of his
learning, pledging his word that he would restore him quickly and safely
again. "Do not," says the high-minded khalif, "let diversity of religion
or of country cause you to refuse my request. Do what friendship would
concede to a friend. In return, I offer you a hundred weight of gold, a
perpetual alliance and peace." True to the instincts of his race and the
traditions of his city, the Byzantine sourly and insolently refused the
request, saying that "the learning which had illustrated the Roman name
should never be imparted to a barbarian."</p>


<p><span class="side">Their great improvements in arithmetic.</span>From the Hindus the Arabs learned arithmetic, especially that valuable
invention termed by us the Arabic numerals, but honourably ascribed by
them to its proper source, under the designation of "Indian numerals."
They also entitled their treatises on the subject "Systems of Indian
Arithmetic." This admirable notation by nine digits and cipher occasioned
a complete revolution in arithmetical computations. As in the case of so
many other things, the Arab impress is upon it; our word cipher, and its
derivatives, ciphering, etc., recall the Arabic word tsaphara or ciphra,
the name for the 0, and meaning that which is blank or void. Mohammed Ben
Musa, said to be the earliest of the Saracen authors on algebra, and who
made the great improvement of substituting sines for chords in
trigonometry, wrote  <span class="pag">[41]</span>  also <a id="on41"></a>on this Indian system. He lived at the end of
the ninth century; before the end of the tenth it was in common use among
the African and Spanish mathematicians. Ebn Junis, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1008, used it in
his astronomical works. From Spain it passed into Italy, its singular
advantage in commercial computation causing it to be eagerly adopted in
the great trading cities. We still use the word algorithm in reference to
calculations. The study of algebra was intently cultivated among the
Arabs, who gave it the name it bears. Ben Musa, just referred to, was the
inventor of the common method of solving quadratic equations.
<span class="side"> Their astronomical discoveries.</span>
 In the
application of mathematics to astronomy and physics they had been long
distinguished. Almaimon had determined with considerable accuracy the
obliquity of the ecliptic. His result, with those of some other Saracen
astronomers, is as follows:</p>

<p class="noindent">Almaimon had also ascertained the size of the earth from the measurement
of a degree on the shore of the Red Sea&mdash;an operation implying true ideas
of its form, and in singular contrast with the doctrine of Constantinople
and Rome. While the latter was asserting, in all its absurdity, the
flatness of the earth, the Spanish Moors were teaching geography in their
common schools from globes. In Africa, there was still preserved, with
almost religious reverence, in the library at Cairo, one of brass,
reputed to have belonged to the great astronomer Ptolemy. Al Idrisi made
one of silver for Roger&nbsp;II., of Sicily; and Gerbert used one which he had
brought from Cordova in the school he established at Rheims. It cost a
struggle of several centuries, illustrated by some martyrdoms, before the
dictum of Lactantius and Augustine could be overthrown. Among problems of
interest that were solved may be mentioned the determination of the
length of the year by Albategnius and Thebit Ben Corrah; and <span class="pag">[42]</span> increased
<a id="accuracy42"></a>accuracy was given to the correction of astronomical observations by
Alhazen's great discovery of atmospheric refraction. Among the
astronomers, some composed tables; some wrote on the measure of time;
some on the improvement of clocks, for which purpose they were the first
to apply the pendulum; some on instruments, as the astrolabe. The
introduction of astronomy into Christian Europe has been attributed to
the translation of the works of Mohammed Fargani. In Europe, also, the
Arabs were the first to build observatories; the Giralda, or tower of
Seville, was erected under the superintendence of Geber, the
mathematician, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1196, for that purpose. Its fate was not a little
characteristic. After the expulsion of the Moors it was turned into a
belfry, the Spaniards not knowing what else to do with it.</p>


<p><span class="side">Europe tries to hide its obligations to them.</span>I have to deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of Europe
has contrived to put out of sight our scientific obligations to the
Mohammedans. Surely they cannot be much longer hidden. Injustice founded
on religious rancour and national conceit cannot be perpetuated for ever.
What should the modern astronomer say when, remembering the contemporary
barbarism of Europe, he finds the Arab Abul Hassan speaking of tubes, to
the extremities of which ocular and object diopters, perhaps sights, were
attached, as used at Meragha? what when he reads of the attempts of
Abderrahman Sufi at improving the photometry of the stars? Are the
astronomical tables of Ebn Junis (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1008), called the Hakemite tables,
or the Ilkanic tables of Nasser Eddin Tasi, constructed at the great
observatory just mentioned, Meragha, near Tauris, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1259, or the
measurement of time by pendulum oscillations, and the methods of
correcting astronomical tables by systematic observations&mdash;are such
things worthless indications of the mental state? The Arab has left his
intellectual impress on Europe, as, before long, Christendom will have to
confess; he has indelibly written it on the heavens, as any one may see
who reads the names of the stars on a common celestial globe.</p>


<p><span class="side">Improvements in the arts of life.</span>Our obligations to the Spanish Moors in the arts of life are even more
marked than in the higher <span class="pag">[43]</span> branches <a id="of43"></a>of science, perhaps only because our
ancestors were better prepared to take advantage of things connected with
daily affairs. They set an example of skilful agriculture, the practice
of which was regulated by a code of laws. Not only did they attend to the
cultivation of plants, introducing very many new ones, they likewise paid
great attention to the breeding of cattle, especially the sheep and
horse. To them we owe the introduction of the great products, rice,
sugar, cotton, and also, as we have previously observed, nearly all the
fine garden and orchard fruits, together with many less important plants,
as spinach and saffron. To them Spain owes the culture of silk; they gave
to Xeres and Malaga their celebrity for wine. They introduced the
Egyptian system of irrigation by flood-gates, wheels, and pumps. They
also promoted many important branches of industry; improved the
manufacture of textile fabrics, earthenware, iron, steel; the Toledo
sword-blades were everywhere prized for their temper. The Arabs, on their
expulsion from Spain, carried the manufacture of a kind of leather, in
which they were acknowledged to excel, to Morocco, from which country the
leather itself has now taken its name. They also introduced inventions of
a more ominous kind&mdash;gunpowder and artillery. The cannon they used
appeared to have been made of wrought iron. But perhaps they more than
compensated for these evil contrivances by the introduction of the
mariner's compass.</p>

<p><span class="side">Their commerce.</span>The  mention of the mariner's compass might lead us correctly to infer
that the Spanish Arabs were interested in commercial pursuits, a
conclusion to which we should also come when we consider the revenues of
some of their khalifs. That of Abderrahman&nbsp;III. is stated at five and a
half million sterling&mdash;a vast sum if considered by its modern equivalent,
and far more than could possibly be raised by taxes on the produce of the
soil. It probably exceeded the entire revenue of all the sovereigns of
Christendom taken together. From Barcelona and other ports an immense
trade with the Levant was maintained, but it was mainly in the hands of
the Jews, who, from the first invasion of Spain by Musa, had ever been
the firm allies <span class="pag">[44]</span> and <a id="collaborators44"></a>collaborators of the Arabs. Together they had
participated in the dangers of the invasion; together they had shared its
boundless success; together they had held in irreverent derision, nay,
even in contempt, the woman-worshippers and polytheistic savages beyond
the Pyrenees&mdash;as they mirthfully called those whose long-delayed
vengeance they were in the end to feel; together they were expelled.
Against such Jews as lingered behind the hideous persecutions of the
Inquisition were directed. But in the days of their prosperity they
maintained a merchant marine of more than a thousand ships. They had
factories and consuls on the Tanaïs. With Constantinople alone they
maintained a great trade; it ramified from the Black Sea and East
Mediterranean into the interior of Asia; it reached the ports of India
and China, and extended along the African coast as far as Madagascar.
Even in these commercial affairs the singular genius of the Jew and Arabs
shines forth. In the midst of the tenth century, when Europe was about in
the same condition that Caffraria is now, enlightened Moors, like Abul
Cassem, were writing treatises on the principles of trade and commerce.
As on so many other occasions, on these affairs they have left their
traces. The smallest weight they used in trade was the grain of barley,
four of which were equal to one sweet pea, called in Arabic carat. We
still use the grain as our unit of weight, and still speak of gold as
being so many carats fine.</p>


<p><span class="side">Obligations to the Khalifs of the West.</span>Such were the Khalifs of the West; such their splendour, their luxury,
their knowledge; such some of the obligations we are under to
them&mdash;obligations which Christian Europe, with singular insincerity, has
ever been fain to hide. The cry against the misbeliever has long outlived
the Crusades. Considering the enchanting country over which they ruled,
it was not without reason that they caused to be engraven on the public
seal, "The servant of the Merciful rests contented in the decrees of
God." What more, indeed, could Paradise give them? But, considering also
the evil end of all this happiness and pomp, this learning, liberality,
and wealth, we may well appreciate the solemn truth which these monarchs,
in their day of pride <span class="pag">[45]</span> and <a id="power45"></a>power, grandly wrote in the beautiful mosaics
on their palace walls, an ever-recurring warning to him who owes dominion
to the sword, "There is no conqueror but God."</p>



<p><span class="side">Examination of Mohammedan science.</span>The value of a philosophical or political system may be determined by its
fruits. On this principle I examined in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31345/31345-h/31345-h.htm#CHAPTER_XII">Vol.&nbsp;I., Chapter&nbsp;XII.,</a> the Italian
system, estimating its religious merit from the biographies of the popes,
which afford the proper criterion. In like manner, the intellectual state
of the Mohammedan nations at successive epochs may be ascertained from
what is its proper criterion, the contemporaneous scientific
manifestation.</p>

<p>At the time when the Moorish influences in Spain began to exert a
pressure on the Italian system, there were several scientific writers,
fragments of whose works have descended to us. As an architect may judge
of the skill of the ancient Egyptians in his art from a study of the
Pyramids, so from these relics of Saracenic learning we may demonstrate
the intellectual state of the Mohammedan people, though much of their
work has been lost and more has been purposely destroyed.</p>


<p><span class="side">Review of the works of Alhazen.</span>Among such writers is Alhazen; his date was about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1100. It appears
that he resided both in Spain and Egypt, but the details of his biography
are very confused. Through his optical works, which have been translated
into Latin, he is best known to Europe. <span class="side"> He corrects the theory of vision.</span>
He was the first to correct the
Greek misconception as to the nature of vision, showing that the rays of
light come from external objects to the eye, and do not issue forth from
the eye, and impinge on external things, as, up to his time, had been
supposed. His explanation does not depend upon mere hypothesis or
supposition, but is plainly based upon anatomical investigation as well
as on geometrical discussion.
<span class="side">Determines the function of the retina. </span>
He determines that the retina is the seat
of vision, and that impressions made by light upon it are conveyed along
the optic nerve to the brain. Though it might not be convenient, at the
time when Alhazen lived, to make such an acknowledgment, no one could
come to these  <span class="pag">[46]</span>conclusions, <a id="nor46"></a>nor, indeed, know anything about these facts,
unless he had been engaged in the forbidden practice of dissection.
<span class="side">Explains single vision.</span>With
felicity he explains that we see single when we use both eyes, because of
the formation of the visual images on symmetrical portions of the two
retinas. To the modern physiologist the mere mention of such things is as
significant as the occurrence of an arch in the interior of the pyramid
is to the architect. But Alhazen shows that our sense of sight is by no
means a trustworthy guide, and that there are illusions arising from the
course which the rays of light may take when they suffer refraction or
reflexion. It is in the discussion of one of these physical problems that
his scientific greatness truly shines forth.
<span class="side">Traces the course of a ray of light through the air. </span>
He is perfectly aware that
the atmosphere decreases in density with increase of height; and from
that consideration he shows that a ray of light, entering it obliquely,
follows a curvilinear path which is concave toward the earth; and that,
since the mind refers the position of an object to the direction in which
the ray of light from it enters the eye, the result must be an illusion
as respects the starry bodies; they appear to us, to use the Arabic term,
nearer to the <i>zenith</i> than they actually are, and not in their true
place.
<span class="side">Astronomical refraction. </span>
We see them in the direction of the tangent to the curve of
refraction as it reaches the eye. Hence also he shows that we actually
see the stars, and the sun, and the moon before they have risen and after
they have set&mdash;a wonderful illusion. He shows that in its passage through
the air the curvature of a ray increases with the increasing density, and
that its path does not depend on vapours that chance to be present, but
on the variation of density in the medium.
<span class="side">The horizontal sun and moon. </span>
To this refraction he truly
refers the shortening, in their vertical diameter, of the horizontal sun
and moon; to its variations he imputes the twinkling of the fixed stars.
The apparent increase of size of the former bodies when they are in the
horizon he refers to a mental deception, arising from the presence of
intervening terrestrial objects.
<span class="side">Explains the twilight. </span>
He shows that the effect of refraction
is to shorten the duration of night and darkness by prolonging the
visibility of the sun, and considering <span class="pag">[47]</span> the <a id="reflecting47"></a>reflecting action of the air,
he deduces that beautiful explanation of the nature of twilight&mdash;the
light that we perceive before the rising and after the setting of the
sun&mdash;which we accept at the present time as true. <span class="side">Determines the height of the atmosphere.</span>
 With extraordinary
acuteness, he applies the principles with which he is dealing to the
determination of the height of the atmosphere, deciding that its limit is
nearly 58 &frac12; miles.</p>

<p>All this is very grand. Shall we compare it with the contemporaneous monk
miracles and monkish philosophy of Europe? It would make a profound
impression if communicated for the first time to a scientific society in
our own age. Nor perhaps does his merit end here. If the Book of the
Balance of Wisdom, for a translation of which we are indebted to M.
Khanikoff, the Russian consul-general at Tabriz, be the production of
Alhazen, of which there seems to be internal proof, it offers us evidence
of a singular clearness in mechanical conception for which we should
scarcely have been prepared, and, if it be not his, at all events it
indisputably shows the scientific acquirements of his age.
<span class="side">The weight of the air. </span>
In that book
is plainly set forth the connexion between the weight of the atmosphere
and its increasing density. The weight of the atmosphere was therefore
understood before Torricelli. This author shows that a body will weigh
differently in a rare and in a dense atmosphere; that its loss of weight
will be greater in proportion as the air is more dense.
<span class="side">Principles of hydrostatics. </span>
He considers the
force with which plunged bodies will rise through heavier media in which
they are immersed, and discusses the submergence of floating bodies, as
ships upon the sea. He understands the doctrine of the centre of gravity.
<span class="side">Theory of the balance.</span>
He applies it to the investigation of balances and steelyards, showing
the relations between the centre of gravity and the centre of
suspension&mdash;when those instruments will set and when they will vibrate.
He recognizes gravity as a force; asserts that it diminishes with the
distance; but falls into the mistake that the diminution is as the
distance, and not as its square.
<span class="side"> Gravity; capillary attraction; the hydrometer.</span>
He considers gravity as terrestrial, and
fails to perceive that it is universal&mdash;that was reserved for Newton. He
knows correctly the <span class="pag">[48]</span> relation <a id="between48"></a>between the velocities, spaces, and times
of falling bodies, and has very distinct ideas of capillary attraction.
He improves the construction of that old Alexandrian invention, the
hydrometer&mdash;the instrument which, in a letter to his fair but pagan
friend Hypatia, the good Bishop of Ptolemais, Synesius, six hundred years
previously, requests her to have made for him in Alexandria, as he wishes
to try the wines he is using, his health being a little delicate.
<span class="side"> Tables of specific gravities.</span>
 The
determinations of the densities of bodies, as given by Alhazen, approach
very closely to our own; in the case of mercury they are even more exact
than some of those of the last century. I join, as, doubtless, all
natural philosophers will do, in the pious prayer of Alhazen, that, in
the day of judgment, the All-Merciful will take pity on the soul of
Abur-Raihân, because he was the first of the race of men to construct a
table of specific gravities; and I will ask the same for Alhazen himself,
since he was the first to trace the curvilinear path of a ray of light
through the air. Though more than seven centuries part him from our
times, the physiologists of this age may accept him as their compeer,
since he received and defended the doctrine now forcing its way, of the
progressive development of animal forms.
<span class="side">The theory of development of organisms.</span>
 He upheld the affirmation of
those who said that man, in his progress, passes through a definite
succession of states; not, however, "that he was once a bull, and was
then changed to an ass, and afterwards into a horse, and after that into
an ape, and finally became a man." This, he says, is only a
misrepresentation by "common people" of what is really meant. The "common
people" who withstood Alhazen have representatives among us, themselves
the only example in the Fauna of the world of that non-development which
they so loudly affirm. At the best they are only passing through some of
the earlier forms of that series of transmutations to which the devout
Mohammedan in the above quotation alludes.</p>


<p>The Arabians, with all this physical knowledge, do not appear to have
been in possession of the thermometer, though they knew the great
importance of temperature <span class="pag">[49]</span> measures, <a id="employing49"></a>employing the areometer for that
purpose. They had detected the variation in density of liquids by heat,
but not the variation in volume. In their measures of time they were more
successful; they had several kinds of clepsydras. A balance clepsydra is
described in the work from which I am quoting.
<span class="side">The pendulum clock.</span>
But it was their great
astronomer, Ebn Junis, who accomplished the most valuable of all
chronometric improvements. He first applied the pendulum to the measure
of time. Laplace, in the fifth note to his Systeme du Monde, avails
himself of the observations of this philosopher, with those of
Albategnius and other Arabians, as incontestable proof of the diminution
of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.
<span class="side"> Astronomical works of Ebn Junis.</span>
 He states, moreover, that the
observation of Ebn Junis of the obliquity of the ecliptic, properly
corrected for parallax and refraction, gives for the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1000 a
result closely approaching to the theoretical. He also mentions another
observation of Ebn Junis, October 31, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1007, as of much importance in
reference to the great inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn.
<span class="side"> The Arabic numerals.</span>
 I have already
remarked that, in the writings of this great Arabian, the Arabic numerals
and our common arithmetical processes are currently used. From Africa and
Spain they passed into Italy, finding ready acceptance among commercial
men, who recognised at once their value, and, as William of Malmesbury
says, being a wonderful relief to the "sweating calculators;" an epithet
of which the correctness will soon appear to any one who will try to do a
common multiplication or division problem by the aid of the old Roman
numerals. It is said that Gerbert&mdash;Pope Sylvester&mdash;was the first to
introduce a knowledge of them into Europe; he had learned them at the
Mohammedan university of Cordova. It is in allusion to the cipher, which
follows the 9, but which, added to any of the other digits, increases by
tenfold its power, that, in a letter to his patron, the Emperor Otho&nbsp;III.,
 with humility he playfully but truly says, "I am like the last of
all the numbers."</p>

<p><span class="side">Arabian philosophy.</span>The overthrow of the Roman by the Arabic numerals foreshadowed the result
of a far more important&mdash;a political&mdash;contest between those rival names.
But, <span class="pag">[50]</span> before <a id="showing50"></a>showing how the Arabian intellect pressed upon Rome, and the
convulsive struggles of desperation which Rome made to resist it, I must
for a moment consider the former under another point of view, and speak
of Saracen philosophy.
<span class="side">The writings of Algazzali. </span>
And here Algazzali shall be my guide. He was born
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1058.</p>

<p>Let us hear him speak for himself. He is relating his attempt to detach
himself from the opinions which he had imbibed in his childhood: "I said
to  myself, 'My aim is simply to know the truth of things; consequently,
it is indispensable for me to ascertain what is knowledge.' Now it was
evident to me that certain knowledge must be that which explains the
object to be known in such a manner that no doubt can remain, so that in
future all error and conjecture respecting it must be impossible.
<span class="side"> The certitude of knowledge.</span>
 Not only would the understanding then need no efforts to be convinced of
certitude, but security against error is in such close connexion with
knowledge, that, even were an apparent proof of falsehood to be brought
forward, it would cause no doubt, because no suspicion of error would be
possible. Thus, when I have acknowledged ten to be more than three, if
any one were to say, 'On the contrary, three is more than ten, and to
prove the truth of my assertion, I will change this rod into a serpent,'
and if he were to change it, my conviction of his error would remain
unshaken. His man&oelig;uvre would only produce in me admiration for his
ability. I should not doubt my own knowledge.</p>


<p>"Then was I convinced that knowledge which I did not possess in this
manner, and respecting which I had not this certainty, could inspire me
with neither confidence nor assurance; and no knowledge without assurance
deserves the name of knowledge.</p>



<p>"Having examined the state of my own knowledge, I found it divested of
all that could be said to have these qualities, unless perceptions of the
senses and irrefragable principles were to be considered such.
<span class="side">Fallibility of the senses.</span>
 I then said to myself, 'Now,
having fallen into this despair, the only hope of
acquiring incontestable convictions is by the perceptions of the senses
and by necessary truths.' Their evidence seemed to me to be <span class="pag">[51]</span> indubitable.
<a id="I51"></a>I began, however, to examine the objects of sensation and speculation, to
see if they possibly could admit of doubt. Then doubts crowded upon me in
such numbers that my incertitude became complete. Whence results the
confidence I have in sensible things? The strongest of all our senses is
sight; and yet, looking at a shadow, and perceiving it to be fixed and
immovable, we judge it to be deprived of movement; nevertheless,
experience teaches us that, when we return to the same place an hour
after, the shadow is displaced, for it does not vanish suddenly, but
gradually, little by little, so as never to be at rest. If we look at the
stars, they seem to be as small as money-pieces; but mathematical proofs
convince us that they are larger than the earth. These and other things
are judged by the senses, but rejected by reason as false. I abandoned
the senses, therefore, having seen all my confidence in their truth
shaken.</p>

<p>"'Perhaps,' said I, 'there is no assurance but in the notions of reason,
that is to say, first principles, as that ten is more than three; the
same thing cannot have been created and yet have existed from all
eternity; to exist and not to exist at the same time is impossible.'</p>


<p><span class="side">Fallibility of reason.</span>"Upon this the senses replied, 'What assurance have you that your
confidence in reason is not of the same nature as your confidence in us?
When you relied on us, reason stepped in and gave us the lie; had not
reason been there, you would have continued to rely on us. Well, may
there not exist some other judge superior to reason, who, if he appeared,
would refute the judgments of reason in the same way that reason refuted
us? The non-appearance of such a judge is no proof of his non-existence.'</p>



<p><span class="side">The nature of dreams.</span>"I strove in vain to answer the objection, and my difficulties increased
when I came to reflect on sleep. I said to myself, 'During sleep, you
give to visions a reality and consistence, and you have no suspicion of
their untruth. On awakening, you are made aware that they were nothing
but visions. What assurance have you that all you feel and know when you
are awake does actually exist? It is all true as respects your condition
at that moment; but it is nevertheless possible <span class="pag">[52]</span> that <a id="another52"></a>another condition
should present itself which should be to your awakened state that which
to your awakened state is now to you sleep; so that, as respects this
higher condition, your waking is but sleep.'"</p>

<p>It would not be possible to find in any European work a clearer statement
of the scepticism to which philosophy leads than what is thus given by
this Arabian. Indeed, it is not possible to put the argument in a more
effective way. His perspicuity is in singular contrast with the obscurity
of many metaphysical writers.</p>


<p><span class="side">Intellectual despair.</span>
"Reflecting on my situation, I found myself bound to this world by a
thousand ties, temptations assailing me on all sides. I then examined my
actions. The best were those relating to instruction and education, and
even there I saw myself given up to unimportant sciences, all useless in
another world. Reflecting on the aim of my teaching, I found it was not
pure in the sight of the Lord. I saw that all my efforts were directed
toward the acquisition of glory to myself. Having, therefore, distributed
my wealth, I left Bagdad and retired into Syria, where I remained two
years in solitary struggle with my soul, combating my passions, and
exercising myself, in the purification of my heart and in preparation for
the other world."</p>

<p>This is a very beautiful picture of the mental struggles and the actions
of a truthful and earnest man. In all this the Christian philosopher can
sympathize with the devout Mohammedan. After all, they are not very far
apart. Algazzali is not the only one to whom such thoughts have occurred,
but he has found words to tell his experience better than any other man.
And what is the conclusion at which he arrives?
<span class="side">Algazzali's ages of man.</span>
 The life of man, he says,
is marked by three stages: "the first, or infantile stage, is that of
pure sensation; the second, which begins at the age of seven, is that of
understanding; the third is that of reason, by means of which the
intellect perceives the necessary, the possible, the absolute, and all
those higher objects which transcend the understanding. But after this
there is a fourth stage, when another eye is opened, by which man
perceives things hidden from others&mdash;perceives all that will
be&mdash;perceives the <span class="pag">[53]</span> things <a id="that53"></a>that escape the perceptions of reason, as the
objects of reason escape the understanding, and as the objects of the
understanding escape the sensitive faculty. This is prophetism."
Algazzali thus finds a philosophical basis for the rule of life, and
reconciles religion and philosophy.</p>

<hr />




<p>And now I have to turn from Arabian civilized life, its science, its
philosophy, to another, a repulsive state of things. With reluctance I
come back to the Italian system, defiling the holy name of religion with
its intrigues, its bloodshed, its oppression of human thought, its hatred
of intellectual advancement.
<span class="side">Renewal of the operation of Mohammedan influences.</span>
Especially I have now to direct attention to
two countries, the scenes of important events&mdash;countries in which the
Mohammedan influences began to take effect and to press upon Rome. These
are the South of France and Sicily.</p>

<p>Innocent&nbsp;III. had been elected pope at the early age of thirty-seven
years, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1198. The papal power had reached its culminating point. The
weapons of the Church had attained their utmost force. In Italy, in
Germany, in France and England, interdicts and excommunications
vindicated the pontifical authority, as in the cases of the Duke of
Ravenna, the Emperor Otho, Philip Augustus of France, King John of
England.
<span class="side">Interference of Innocent III. in France.</span>
In each of these cases it was not for the sake of sustaining
great moral principles or the rights of humanity that the thunder was
launched&mdash;it was in behalf of temporary political interests; interests
that, in Germany, were sustained at the cost of a long war, and cemented
by assassination; in France, strengthened by the well-tried device of an
intervention in a matrimonial broil&mdash;the domestic quarrel of the king and
queen about Agnes of Meran. "Ah! happy Saladin!" said the insulted
Philip, when his kingdom was put under interdict; "he has no pope above
him. I too will turn Mohammedan."</p>



<p><span class="side">In Spain and Portugal.</span>So, likewise, in Spain, Innocent interfered in the matrimonial life of
the King of Leon. The remorseless venality of the papal government was
felt in every direction. Portugal had already been advanced to the
dignity of a kingdom on payment of an <span class="pag">[54]</span> annual <a id="tribute54"></a>tribute to Rome. The King
of Aragon held his kingdom as feudatory to the pope.</p>


<p><span class="side">In England; denounces Magna Charta.</span>In England, Innocent's interference assumed a different aspect. He
attempted to assert his control over the Church in spite of the king, and
put the nation under interdict because John would not permit Stephen
Langton to be Archbishop of Canterbury. It was utterly impossible that
affairs could go on with such an empire within an empire. For his
contumacy, John was excommunicated; but, base as he was, he defied his
punishment for four years. Hereupon his subjects were released from their
allegiance, and his kingdom offered to anyone who would conquer it. In
his extremity, the King of England is said to have sent a messenger to
Spain, offering to become a Mohammedan. The religious sentiment was then
no higher in him than it was, under a like provocation, in the King of
France, whose thoughts turned in the same direction. But, pressed
irresistibly by Innocent, John was compelled to surrender his realm,
agreeing to pay to the pope, in addition to Peter's pence, 1000 marks a
year as a token of vassalage. When the prelates whom he had refused or
exiled returned, he was compelled to receive them on his
knees&mdash;humiliations which aroused the indignation of the stout English
barons, and gave strength to those movements which ended in extorting
Magna Charta. Never, however, was Innocent more mistaken than in the
character of Stephen Langton. John had, a second time, formally
surrendered his realm to the pope, and done homage to the legate for it;
but Stephen Langton was the first&mdash;at a meeting of the chiefs of the
revolt against the king, held in London, August 25th, 1213&mdash;to suggest
that they should demand a renewal of the charter of Henry&nbsp;I. From this
suggestion Magna Charta originated. Among the miracles of the age, he was
the greatest miracle of all; his patriotism was stronger than his
profession. The wrath of the pontiff knew no bounds when he learned that
the Great Charter had been conceded. In his bull, he denounced it as base
and ignominious; he anathematized the king if he observed it; he declared
it null and void. It was not the policy of the Roman court to permit <span class="pag">[55]</span> so
<a id="much55"></a>much as the beginnings of such freedom. The appointment of Simon Langton
to the archbishopric of York was annulled. One De Gray was substituted
for him. It illustrated the simony into which the papal government had
fallen, that De Gray had become, in these transactions, indebted to Rome
ten thousand pounds.
<span class="side">The drain of money from that country.</span>
 In fact, through the operation of the Crusades, all
Europe was tributory to the pope. He had his fiscal agents in every
metropolis; his travelling ones wandering in all directions, in every
country, raising revenue by the sale of dispensations for all kinds of
offences, real and fictitious&mdash;money for the sale of appointments, high
and low&mdash;a steady drain of money from every realm. Fifty years after the
time of which we are speaking, Robert Grostête, the Bishop of Lincoln and
friend of Roger Bacon, caused to be ascertained the amount received by
foreign ecclesiastics in England. He found it to be thrice the income of
the king himself. This was on the occasion of Innocent&nbsp;IV. demanding
provision to be made for three hundred additional Italian clergy by the
Church of England, and that one of his nephews&mdash;a mere boy&mdash;should have a
stall in Lincoln cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="side">Goading of Europe into a new crusade. </span>While thus Innocent&nbsp;III. was interfering and intriguing with every court,
and laying every people under tribute, he did not for a moment permit his
attention to be diverted from the Crusades, the singular advantages of
which to the papacy had now been fully discovered. They had given to the
pope a suzerainty in Europe, the control of its military as well as its
monetary resources. Not that a man like Innocent could permit himself to
be deluded by any hopes of eventual success. The crusades must inevitably
prove, so far as their avowed object was concerned, a failure. The
Christian inhabitants of Palestine were degraded and demoralized beyond
description. Their ranks were thinned by apostasy to Mohammedanism. In
Europe, not only the laity begun to discover that the money provided for
the wars in the Holy Land was diverted from its purpose, and in some
inexplicable manner, found its way into Italy&mdash;even the clergy could not
conceal their suspicions that the proclamation of a crusade was <span class="pag">[56]</span> merely
<a id="the56"></a>the preparation for a swindle. Nevertheless, Innocent pressed forward his
schemes, goading on Christendom by upbraiding it with the taunts of the
Saracens. "Where," they say, "is your God, who can not deliver you out of
our hands? Behold! we have defiled your sanctuaries; we have stretched
forth our arm; we have taken at the first assault, we hold in despite of
you, those your desirable places, where your superstition had its
beginning. Where is your God? Let him arise and protect you and himself."
"If thou be the Son of God, save thyself if thou canst; redeem the land
of thy birth from our hands. Restore thy cross, that we have taken, to
the worshippers of the Cross." With great difficulty, however, Innocent
succeeded in preparing the fourth crusade, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1202. The Venetians
consented to furnish a fleet of transports. But the expedition was
quickly diverted from its true purpose; the Venetians employing the
Crusaders for the capture of Zara from the King of Hungary.
<span class="side">The crusade is used for the seizure of Constantinople. </span>
Still worse, and shameful to be said&mdash;partly from the lust of plunder, and partly
through ecclesiastical machinations&mdash;it again turned aside for an attack
upon Constantinople, and took that city by storm <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1204, thereby
establishing Latin Christianity in the Eastern metropolis, but, alas!
with bloodshed, rape, and fire. On the night of the assault more houses
were burned than could be found in any three of the largest cities in
France.
<span class="side">Sack of that city by the Catholics. </span>
Even Christian historians compare with shame the storming of
Constantinople by the Catholics with the capture of Jerusalem by Saladin.
Pope Innocent himself was compelled to protest against enormities that
had outrun his intentions. He says: "They practised fornications,
incests, adulteries in the sight of men. They abandoned matrons and
virgins, consecrated to God, to the lewdness of grooms. They lifted their
hands against the treasures of the churches&mdash;what is more heinous, the
very consecrated vessels&mdash;tearing the tablets of silver from the very
altars, breaking in pieces the most sacred things, carrying off crosses
and relics." In St. Sophia, the silver was stripped from the pulpit; an
exquisite and highly-prized table of oblation was broken in pieces; the
sacred chalices were <span class="pag">[57]</span> turned <a id="into57"></a>into drinking-cups; the gold fringe was
ripped off the veil of the sanctuary. Asses and horses were led into the
churches to carry off the spoil. A prostitute mounted the patriarch's
throne, and sang, with indecent gestures, a ribald song. The tombs of the
emperors were rifled; and the Byzantines saw, at once with amazement and
anguish, the corpse of Justinian&mdash;which even decay and putrefaction had
for six centuries spared in his tomb&mdash;exposed to the violation of a mob.
It had been understood among those who instigated these atrocious
proceedings that the relics were to be brought into a common stock and
equitably divided among the conquerors! but each ecclesiastic seized and
secreted whatever he could. The idolatrous state of the Eastern Church is
illustrated by some of these relics.
<span class="side">The relics found there,</span>
 Thus the Abbot Martin obtained for
his monastery in Alsace the following inestimable articles: 1. A spot of
the blood of our Saviour; 2. A piece of the true cross; 3. The arm of the
Apostle James; 4. Part of the skeleton of John the Baptist; 5.&mdash;I
hesitate to write such blasphemy&mdash;"A bottle of the milk of the Mother of
God!" <span class="side"> and works of art destroyed.</span>
In contrast with the treasures thus acquired may be set relics of a
very different kind, the remains of ancient art which they destroyed: 1.
The bronze charioteers from the Hippodrome; 2. The she-wolf suckling
Romulus and Remus; 3. A group of a Sphinx, river-horse, and crocodile; 4.
An eagle tearing a serpent; 5. An ass and his driver, originally cast by
Augustus in memory of the victory of Actium; 6. Bellerophon and Pegasus;
7. A bronze obelisk; 8. Paris presenting the apple to Venus; 9. An
exquisite statute of Helen; 10. The Hercules of Lysippus; 11. A Juno,
formerly taken from the temple at Samos. The bronzes were melted into
coin, and thousands of manuscripts and parchments were burned. From that
time the works of many ancient authors disappeared altogether.</p>


<p><span class="side">The pope and the doge divide the spoil. </span>With well-dissembled regret, Innocent took the new order of things in the
city of Constantinople under his protection. The bishop of Rome at last
appointed the Bishop of Constantinople. The acknowledgment of papal
supremacy was complete. Rome and Venice <span class="pag">[58]</span> divided <a id="between58"></a>between them the
ill-gotten gains of their undertaking. If anything had been wanting to
open the eyes of Europe, surely what had thus occurred should have been
enough. The pope and the doge&mdash;the trader in human credulity and the
trader of the Adriatic&mdash;had shared the spoils of a crusade meant by
religious men for the relief of the Holy Land.
<span class="side">Works of art carried to Venice.</span>
 The bronze horses, once
brought by Augustus from Alexandria, after his victory over Antony and
transferred from Rome to Constantinople by its founder, were set before
the Church of St Mark. They were the outward and visible sign of a less
obvious event that was taking place. For to Venice was brought a residue
of the literary treasures that had escaped the fire and the destroyer;
and while her comrades in the outrage were satisfied, in their ignorance,
with fictitious relics, she took possession of the poor remnant of the
glorious works of art, of letters, and of science. Through these was
hastened the intellectual progress of the West.</p>

<p><span class="side">The punishment of Constantinople.</span>So fell Constantinople, and fell by the parricidal hands of Christians.
The days of retribution for the curse she had inflicted on Western
civilization were now approaching. In these events she received a first
instalment of her punishment. Three hundred years previously, the
historian Luitprand, who was sent by the Emperor Otho&nbsp;I. to the court of
Nicephorus Phocas, says of her, speaking as an eye-witness, "That city,
once so wealthy, so flourishing, is now famished, lying, perjured,
deceitful, rapacious, greedy, niggardly, vainglorious;" and since
Luitprand's time she had been pursuing a downward career. It might have
been expected that the concentration of all the literary and scientific
treasures of the Roman empire in Constantinople would have given rise to
great mental vigour&mdash;that to Europe she would have been a brilliant focus
of light.
<span class="side">The literary worthlessness of that city.</span>
But when the works on jurisprudence by Tribonian, under
Justinian, have been mentioned, what is there that remains? There is
Stephanus, the grammarian, who wrote a dictionary, and Procopius, the
historian, who was secretary to Belisarius in his campaigns. There is
then a long interval <span class="pag">[59]</span> almost <a id="without59"></a>without a literary name, to Theophylact
Simocatta, and to the Ladder of Paradise of John Climacus. The mental
excitement of the iconoclastic dispute presents us with John of Damascus;
and the ninth century, the Myriobiblion and Nomacanon of Photius. Then
follows Constantine Porphyrogenitus, vainly and voluminously composing;
and Basil&nbsp;II. doubtless truly expresses the opinion of the time, as he
certainly does the verdict of posterity respecting the works of his
country, when he says that learning is useless and unprofitable lumber.
The Alexiad of Anna Comnena, and the history of Byzantine affairs by
Nicephorous Bryennius, hardly redeem their age. This barrenness and
worthlessness was the effect of the system introduced by Constantine the
Great. The long line of emperors had been consistent in one policy&mdash;the
repression or expulsion of philosophy; and yet it is the uniform
testimony of those ages that the Eastern convents were full of secret
Platonism&mdash;that in stealth, the doctrines of Plato were treasured up in
the cells of Asiatic monks. The Byzantines had possessed in art and
letters all the best models in the world, yet in a thousand years they
never produced one original. Millions of Greeks never advanced one step
in philosophy or science&mdash;never made a single practical discovery,
composed no poem, no tragedy worth perusal. The spirit of their
superficial literature&mdash;if literature it can be called&mdash;is well shadowed
forth in the story of the patriarch Photius, who composed at Bagdad, at a
distance from his library, an analysis of 280 works he had formerly read.
<span class="side">The absurdity of its intellectual pursuits.</span>
The final age of the city was signalized by the Baarlamite controversy
respecting the mysterious light of Mount Thabor&mdash;the possibility of
producing a beatific vision and of demonstrating, by an unceasing
inspection of the navel for days and nights together, the existence of
two eternal principles, a visible and an invisible God!</p>


<p><span class="side">Cause of all this.</span>What was it that produced this barrenness, this intellectual degradation
in Constantinople? The tyranny of Theology over Thought.</p>

<p>But with the capture of Constantinople by the Latins other important
events were occurring. Everywhere <span class="pag">[60]</span> an <a id="intolerance60"></a>intolerance of papal power was
engendering.
<span class="side"> Heresy follows literature. </span>
The monasteries became infected, and even from the holy lips
of monks words of ominous import might be heard. In the South of France
the intellectual insurrection first took form. There the influence of the
Mohammedans and Jews beyond the Pyrenees began to manifest itself.
<span class="side"> Spread of gay literature from Spain.</span>
The songs of gallantry; tensons, or poetical contests of minstrels; satires
of gay defiance; rivalry in praise of the ladies; lays, serenades,
pastourelles, redondes, such as had already drawn forth the condemnation
of the sedate Mussulmen of Cordova, had gradually spread through Spain
and found a congenial welcome in France.
<span class="side"> The Troubadours and Trouvères. </span>
The Troubadours were singing in
the langue d'Oc in the south, and the Trouvères in the langue d'Oil in
the north. Thence the merry epidemic spread to Sicily and Italy. Men felt
that a relief from the grim ecclesiastic was coming. Kings, dukes,
counts, knights, prided themselves on their gentle prowess. The humbler
minstrels found patronage among ladies and at courts: sly satires against
the priests, and amorous ditties, secured them a welcome among the
populace. When the poet was deficient in voice, a jongleur went with him
to sing; and often there was added the pleasant accompaniment of a
musical instrument. The Provençal or langue d'Oc was thus widely
diffused; it served the purposes of those unacquainted with Latin, and
gave the Italians a model for thought and versification, to Europe the
germs of many of its future melodies. While the young were singing, the
old were thinking; while the gay were carried away with romance, the
grave were falling into heresy. <span class="side">Commencing resistance of Rome.</span>
But, true to her instincts and
traditions, the Church had shown her determination to deal rigorously
with all such movements. Already, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1134, Peter de Brueys had been
burned in Languedoc for denying infant baptism, the worship of the cross,
and transubstantiation. Already Henry the Deacon, the disciple of Peter,
had been disposed of by St. Bernard. Already the valleys of Piedmont were
full of Waldenses. Already the Poor Men of Lyons were proclaiming the
portentous doctrine that the sanctity of a priest lay not in his office,
but in <span class="pag">[61]</span> the <a id="manner61"></a>manner of his life. They denounced the wealth of the Church,
and the intermingling of bishops in bloodshed and war; they denied
transubstantiation, invocation of saints, purgatory, and especially
directed their hatred against the sale of indulgences for sin. The rich
cities of Languedoc were full of misbelievers. They were given up to
poetry, music, dancing. Their people, numbers of whom had been in the
Crusades or in Spain, had seen the Saracens. Admiration had taken the
place of detestation. Amid shouts of laughter, the Troubadours went
through the land, wagging their heads, and slyly winking their eyes, and
singing derisive songs about the amours of the priests, and amply earning
denunciations as lewd blasphemers and atheists.
<span class="side"> Innocent III. alarmed at the spread of heresy. </span>
Here was a state of things demanding the attention
of Innocent. The methods he took for its
correction have handed his name down to the maledictions of posterity. He
despatched a missive to the Count of Toulouse&mdash;who already lay under
excommunication for alleged intermeddling with the rights of the
clergy&mdash;charging him with harbouring heretics and giving offices of
emolument to Jews. The count was a man of gay life, having, in emulation
of some of his neighbours across the Pyrenees, not fewer than three
wives. His offences of that kind were, however, eclipsed by those with
which he was now formally charged. It chanced that, in the ensuing
disputes, the pope's legate was murdered. There is no reason to believe
that Raymond was concerned in the crime.
<span class="side">He proclaims a crusade against the Count of Toulouse, </span>
 But the indignant pope held him
responsible; instantly ordered to be published in all directions his
excommunication, and called upon Western Christendom to engage in a
crusade against him, offering, to him whoever chose to take them, the
wealth and possessions of the offender. So thoroughly was he seconded by
the preaching of the monks, that half a million of men, it is affirmed,
took up arms.</p>


<p><span class="side"> and disciplines him.</span>For the count there remained nothing but to submit. He surrendered up his
strong places, was compelled to acknowledge the crimes alleged against
him, and the justice of his punishment. He swore that he would no longer
protect heretics. Stripped naked <span class="pag">[62]</span> to <a id="his62"></a>his middle, with a rope round his
neck, he was led to the altar, and there scourged. But the immense army
that had assembled was not to be satisfied by these inflictions on an
individual, though the pope might be. They had come for blood and
plunder, and blood and plunder they must have. Then followed such scenes
of horror as the sun had never looked on before. The army was officered
by Roman and French prelates; bishops were its generals, an archdeacon
its engineer.
<span class="side">Atrocities of the Crusaders in the South of France.</span>
  It was the Abbot Arnold, the legate of the pope, who, at
the capture of Beziers, was inquired of by a soldier, more merciful or
more weary of murder than himself, how he should distinguish and save the
Catholic from the heretic. "Kill them all," he exclaimed; "God will know
his own." At the Church of St. Mary Magdalene 7000 persons were
massacred, the infuriated Crusaders being excited to madness by the
wicked assertion that these wretches had been guilty of the blasphemy of
saying, in their merriment, "S. Mariam Magdalenam fuisse concubinam
Christi." It was of no use for them to protest their innocence. In the
town twenty thousand were slaughtered, and the place then fired, to be
left a monument of papal vengeance. At the massacre of Lavaur 400 people
were burned in one pile; it is remarked that "they made a wonderful
blaze, and went to burn everlastingly in hell." Language has no powers to
express the atrocities that took place at the capture of the different
towns. Ecclesiastical vengeance rioted in luxury. The soil was steeped in
the blood of men&mdash;the air polluted by their burning.
<span class="side">Institution of the Inquisition.</span>
From the reek of murdered women, mutilated children, and ruined cities, the Inquisition,
that infernal institution, arose. Its projectors intended it not only to
put an end to public teaching, but even to private thought. In the midst
of these awful events, Innocent was called to another tribunal to render
his account. He died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1216.</p>


<p><span class="side">Establishment of mendicant orders.</span>It was during the pontificate of this great criminal that the mendicant
orders were established. The course of ages had brought an
unintelligibility into public worship. The old dialects had become
obsolete; new languages were forming. Among <span class="pag">[63]</span> those <a id="classes63"></a>classes, daily
increasing in number, whose minds were awakening, an earnest desire for
instruction was arising. Multitudes were crowding to hear philosophical
discourses in the universities, and heresy was spreading very fast. But
it was far from being confined to the intelligent. The lower orders
furnished heretics and fanatics too. To antagonize the labours of these
zealots&mdash;who, if they had been permitted to go on unchecked, would
quickly have disseminated their doctrines through all classes of
society&mdash;the Dominican and Franciscan orders were founded. They were well
adapted for their duty. It was their business to move among the people,
preaching to them, in their own tongue, wherever an audience could be
collected. The scandal under which the Church was labouring because of
her wealth could not apply to these persons who lived by begging alms.
Their function was not to secure their own salvation, but that of other
men.</p>


<p><span class="side">St. Dominic.</span>St. Dominic was born <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1170. His birth and life were adorned with the
customary prodigies. Miracles and wonders were necessary for anything to
make a sensation in the West. His was an immaculate conception, he was
free from original sin. He was regarded as the adopted son of the Virgin;
some were even disposed to assign him a higher dignity than that. He
began his operations in Languedoc; but, as the prospect opened out before
him, he removed from that unpromising region to Rome, the necessary
centre of all such undertakings as his. Here he perfected his
organization; instituted his friars, nuns, and tertiaries; and
consolidated his pretensions by the working of many miracles. He
exorcised three matrons, from whom Satan issued forth under the form of a
great black cat, which ran up a bell-rope and vanished. A beautiful nun
resolved to leave her convent. Happening to blow her nose, it dropped off
into her handkerchief; but, at the fervent prayer of St. Dominic, it was
replaced, and in gratitude, tempered by fear, she remained. St. Dominic
could also raise the dead. Nevertheless, he died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1221, having
worthily obtained the title of the burner and slayer of heretics. To him
has been attributed the glory or the crime of being the inventor of "the
Holy Inquisition." In a very few years his order boasted <span class="pag">[64]</span> of <a id="nearly64"></a>nearly 500
monasteries, scattered over Europe, Asia, Africa.</p>


<p><span class="side">St. Francis.</span>St. Francis, the compeer of St. Dominic, was born <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1182. His
followers delighted to point out, as it would seem not without
irreverence, a resemblance to the incidents that occurred at the birth of
our Lord. A prophetess foretold it; he was born in a stable; angels sung
forth peace and good-will in the air; one, under the form of Simeon, bore
him to baptism. In early life he saw visions and became ecstatic. His
father, Peter Bernardini, a respectable tradesman, endeavoured to
restrain his eccentricities, at first by persuasion, but eventually more
forcibly, appealing for assistance to the bishop, to prevent the young
enthusiast from squandering his means in alms to the poor. On that
functionary's gently remonstrating, and pointing out to Francis his
filial obligations, he stripped himself naked before the people,
exclaiming, "Peter Bernardini was my father; I have now but one Father,
he that is in heaven." At this affecting renunciation of all earthly
possessions and earthly ties, those present burst into tears, and the
good bishop threw his own mantle over him. When a man has come to this
pass, there is nothing he cannot accomplish.</p>


<p><span class="side">Authorization of these orders.</span>It is related that, when application was first made to Innocent to
authorize the order, he refused; but, very soon recognizing the
advantages that would accrue, he gave it his hearty patronage. So rapid
was the increase, that in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1219 it numbered not fewer than five
thousand brethren. It was founded on the principles of chastity, poverty,
obedience. They were to live on alms, but never to receive money. After a
life of devotion to the Church, St. Francis attained his reward, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1226. Two years previous to his death, by a miraculous intervention there
were impressed on his person marks answering to the wounds on our
Saviour. These were the celebrated stigmata. A black growth, like nails,
issued forth from the palms of his hands and his feet; a wound from which
blood and water distilled opened in his side. It is not to be wondered at
that these prodigies met with general belief. This was the generation
which received as inestimable relics, <span class="pag">[65]</span> through <a id="Andrew65"></a>Andrew of Hungary, the
skulls of St. Stephen and St. Margaret, the hands of St. Bartholomew and
St. Thomas, a slip of the rod of Aaron, and one of the water-pots of the
marriage at Cana in Galilee.</p>


<p><span class="side">Influence derived from these orders.</span>The papal government quickly found the prodigious advantage arising from
the institution of these mendicant orders. Vowed to poverty, living on
alms, hosts of friars, begging and barefoot, pervaded all Europe, coming
in contact, under the most favourable circumstances, with the lowest
grades of society. They lived and moved among the populace, and yet were
held sacred. The accusations of dissipation and luxury so forcibly urged
against the regular clergy were altogether inapplicable to these
rope-bound, starving fanatics. Through them the Italian government had
possession of the ear of Europe. The pomp of worship in an unknown
tongue, the gorgeous solemnities of the Church, were far more than
compensated by the preaching of these missionaries, who held forth in the
vernacular wherever an audience could be had. Among the early ones, some
had been accustomed to a wandering life. Brother Pacificus, a disciple of
St. Francis, had been a celebrated Trouvère. In truth, they not only
warded off the present pressing danger, but through them the Church
retained her hold on the labouring classes for several subsequent
centuries. The pope might truly boast that the Poor Men of the Church
were more than a match for the Poor Men of Lyons. Their influence began
to diminish only when they abandoned their essential principles, joined
in the common race for plunder, and became immensely rich.</p>


<p><span class="side">Introduction of auricular confession.</span>Not only did Innocent&nbsp;III. thus provide himself with an ecclesiastical
militia suited to meet the obviously impending insurrection, he increased
his power greatly but insidiously by the formal introduction of auricular
confession. It was by the fourth Lateran Council that the necessity of
auricular confession was first formally established. Its aim was that no
heretic should escape, and that the absent priest should be paramount
even in the domestic circle. In none but a most degraded and
superstitious society can such an infamous institution be tolerated. It
invades the <span class="pag">[66]</span> sacred <a id="privacy66"></a>privacy of life&mdash;makes a man's wife, children, and
servants his spies and accusers. When any religious system stands in need
of such a social immorality, we may be sure that it is irrecoverably
diseased, and hastening to its end.</p>


<p><span class="side">Development of casuistry.</span>Auricular confession led to an increasing necessity for casuistry, though
that science was not fully developed until the time of the Jesuits, when
it gave rise to an extensive literature, with a lax system and a false
morality, guiding the penitent rather with a view to his usefulness to
the Church than to his own reformation, and not hesitating at singular
indecencies in its portion having reference to married life.</p>



<p><span class="side">Attitude of Innocent&nbsp;III.</span>Great historical events often find illustrations in representative men.
Such is the case in the epoch we are now considering. On one side stands
Innocent, true to the instincts of his party, interfering with all the
European nations; launching forth his interdicts and excommunications;
steeped in the blood of French heretics; hesitating at no atrocity, even
the outrage and murder of women and children, the ruin of flourishing
cities, to compass his plans; in all directions, under a thousand
pretences, draining Europe of its money; calling to his aid hosts of
begging friars; putting forth imposture miracles; organizing the
Inquisition, and invading the privacy of life by the contrivance of
auricular confession.</p>



<p><span class="side">Attitude of Frederick&nbsp;II.</span>On the other side stands Frederick&nbsp;II., the Emperor of Germany. His early
life, as has been already mentioned, was spent in Sicily, in familiar
intercourse with Jews and Arabs, and Sicily to the last was the favoured
portion of his dominions. To his many other accomplishments he added the
speaking of Arabic as fluently as a Saracen. He delighted in the society
of Mohammedan ladies, who thronged his court. His enemies asserted that
his chastity was not improved by his associations with these miscreant
beauties. The Jewish and Mohammedan physicians and philosophers taught
him to sneer at the pretensions of the Church.
<span class="side">His Mohammedan tendencies.</span>
From such ridicule it is
but a short step to the shaking off of authority. At this time the
Spanish Mohammedans had become widely infected with irreligion; their
greatest philosophers were infidel in <span class="pag">[67]</span> their <a id="own67"></a>own infidelity. The two sons
of Averroes of Cordova are said to have been residents at Frederick's
court. Their father was one of the ablest men their nation ever produced:
an experienced astronomer, he had translated the Almagest, and, it is
affirmed, was the first who actually saw a transit of Mercury across the
sun; a voluminous commentator on the works of Plato and Aristotle, but a
disbeliever in all revelation. Even of Mohammedanism he said, alluding to
the prohibition which the Prophet had enjoined on the use of the flesh of
swine, "That form of religion is destitute of every thing that can
commend it to the approval of any understanding, unless it be that of a
hog."
<span class="side">He cultivates light literature and heresy.</span>
In the Sicilian court, surrounded by such profane influences, the
character of the young emperor was formed. Italian poetry, destined for
such a brilliant future, here first found a voice in the sweet Sicilian
dialect. The emperor and his chancellor were cultivators of the gay
science, and in the composition of sonnets were rivals. A love of amatory
poetry had spread from the South of France.</p>

<p>With a view to the recovery of the Holy Land, Honorius&nbsp;III. had made
Frederick marry Yolinda de Lusignan, the heiress of the kingdom of
Jerusalem. It was not, therefore, to be wondered at that Frederick's
frivolities soon drew upon him the indignation of the gloomy Pope Gregory&nbsp;IX.,
 the very first act of whose pontificate was to summon a new crusade.
<span class="side">Refuses to go on a crusade, and then goes. </span>
To the exhortations and commands of the aged pope the emperor lent a most
reluctant ear, postponing, from time to time, the period of his
departure, and dabbling in doubtful negotiations, through his Mohammedan
friends, with the Sultan of Egypt. He embarked at last, but in three days
returned. The octogenarian pope was not to be trifled with, and
pronounced his excommunication. Frederick treated it with ostensible
contempt, but appealed to Christendom, accusing Rome of avaricious
intentions.
<span class="side">Presumes to rebuke the pontifical government. </span>
Her officials, he said, were travelling in all directions,
not to preach the Word of God, but to extort money. "The primitive
Church, founded on poverty and simplicity, brought forth numberless
saints. The Romans are now rolling in <span class="pag">[68]</span> wealth. <a id="What68"></a>What wonder that the walls
of the Church are undermined to the base, and threaten utter ruin." For
saying this he underwent a more tremendous excommunication; but his
partisans in Rome, raising an insurrection, expelled the pope. And now
Frederick set sail, of his own accord, on his crusading expedition. On
reaching the Holy Land, he was received with joy by the knights and
pilgrims; but the clergy held aloof from him as an excommunicated person.
The pontiff had despatched a swift-sailing ship to forbid their holding
intercourse with him.
<span class="side">His friendship with the sultan, </span>
His private negotiations with the Sultan of Egypt
now matured. The Christian camp was thronged with infidel delegates: some
came to discuss philosophical questions, some were the bearers of
presents. Elephants and a bevy of dancing-girls were courteously sent by
the sultan to his friend, who, it is said, was not insensible to the
witcheries of these Oriental beauties. He wore a Saracen dress. In his
privacy he did not hesitate to say, "I came not here to deliver the Holy
City, but to maintain my estimation among the Franks." To the sultan he
appealed, "Out of your goodness, surrender to me Jerusalem as it is, that
I may be able to lift up my head among the kings of Christendom."
<span class="side">who gives up Jerusalem to him. </span>
Accordingly, the city was surrendered to him. The object of his
expedition was accomplished. But the pope was not to be deceived by such
collusions. He repudiated the transactions altogether, and actually took
measures to lay Jerusalem and our Saviour's sepulchre under interdict,
and this in the face of the Mohammedans.
<span class="side">The pope denounces him.</span>
 While the emperor proclaimed his
successes to Europe, the pope denounced them as coming from the union of
Christ and Belial; alleging four accusations against Frederick: 1. That
he had given the sword which he had received from the altar of St. Peter
for the defence of the faith, as a present to the Sultan of Babylon; 2.
That he had permitted the preaching of the Koran in the holy Temple
itself; 3. That he had excluded the Christians of Antioch from his
treaty; 4. That he had bound himself, if a Christian army should attempt
to cleanse the Temple and city from Mohammedan defilements, to join the
Saracens.</p>

<p>Frederick crowned himself at Jerusalem, unable to <span class="pag">[69]</span> find <a id="any69"></a>any ecclesiastic
who dared to perform the ceremony, and departed from the Holy Land. It
was time, for Rome was intriguing against him at home, a false report of
his death having been industriously circulated. He forthwith prepared to
enter on his conflict with the pontiff.
<span class="side">Frederick establishes Saracen posts in Italy.</span>
 His Saracen colonies at Nocera
and Luceria, in Italy, could supply him with 30,000 Mussulman soldiers,
with whom it was impossible for his enemies to tamper. He managed to draw
over the general sentiment of Europe to his side, and publicly offered to
convict the pope himself of negotiations with the infidels; but his
antagonist, conveniently impressed with a sudden horror of shedding
blood, gave way, and peace between the parties was made. It lasted nearly
nine years.</p>


<p><span class="side">His political institutions.</span>
In this period, the intellectual greatness of Frederick, and the
tendencies of the influences by which he was enveloped, were strikingly
manifested. In advance of his age, he devoted himself to the political
improvement of Sicily. He instituted representative parliaments; enacted
a system of wise laws; asserted the principle of equal rights and equal
burdens, and the supremacy of the law over all, even the nobles and the
Church. He provided for the toleration of all professions, Jewish and
Mohammedan, as well as Christian; emancipated all the serfs of his
domains; instituted cheap justice for the poor; forbade private war;
regulated commerce&mdash;prophetically laying down some of those great
principles, which only in our own time have been finally received as
true; established markets and fairs; collected large libraries; caused to
be translated such works as those of Aristotle and Ptolemy; built
menageries for natural history; founded in Naples a great university;
patronized the medical college at Salernum; made provisions for the
education of promising but indigent youths. All over the land splendid
architectural triumphs were created. Under him the Italian language first
rose above a patois. Sculpture, painting, and music were patronized. His
chancellor is said to have been the author of the oldest sonnet.</p>


<p>In the eye of Rome all this was an abomination. Were human laws to take
the precedence of the law of God? Were the clergy to be degraded to a
level with the laity? <span class="pag">[70]</span> <a id="Were70"></a>Were the Jew and the Mohammedan to be permitted their infamous rites? Was
this new-born product of the insolence of human intellect&mdash;this so-called
science&mdash;to be brought into competition with theology, the
heaven-descended?
<span class="side">They are denounced.</span>
Frederick and his parliaments, his laws and
universities, his libraries, his statues, his pictures and sonnets, were
denounced. Through all, the ever-watchful eye of the Church discerned the
Jew and the Saracen, and held them up to the abhorrence of Europe. But
Gregory was not unwilling to show what could be done by himself in the
same direction. He caused a compilation of the Decretals to be issued,
intrusting the work to one Raymond de Pennaforte, who had attained
celebrity as a literary opponent of the Saracens. It is amusing to remark
that even this simple work of labour could not be promulgated without the
customary embellishments. It was given out that an angel watched over
Pennaforte's shoulder all the time he was writing.</p>


<p><span class="side">Outbreak of his quarrel with the pope,</span>Meantime an unceasing vigilance was maintained against the dangerous
results that would necessarily ensue from Frederick's movements. In Rome,
many heretics were burned; many condemned to imprisonment for life. The
quarrel between the pope and the emperor was resumed; the latter being
once more excommunicated, and his body delivered over to Satan for the
good of his soul. Again Frederick appealed to all the sovereigns of
Christendom. He denounced the pontiff as an unworthy vicar of Christ,
"who sits in his court like a merchant, weighing out dispensations for
gold&mdash;himself writing and signing the bulls, perhaps counting the money.
He has but one cause of enmity against me, that I refused to marry to his
niece my natural son Enzio, now King of Sardinia." "In the midst of the
Church sits a frantic prophet, a man of falsehood, a polluted priest." To
this Gregory replied.
<span class="side">who rouses Christendom against him.</span>
The tenor of his answer may be gathered from its
commencement: "Out of the sea a beast is arisen, whose name is written
all over 'Blasphemy.'" "He falsely asserts that I am enraged at his
refusing his consent to the marriage of my niece with his natural son. He
lies more impudently when he says that <span class="pag">[71]</span> I <a id="have71"></a>have pledged my faith to the
Lombards." "In truth, this pestilent king maintains, to use his own
words, that the world has been deceived by three impostors&mdash;Jesus Christ,
Moses, and Mohammed; that of these two died in honour, and the third was
hanged on a tree. Even now, he has asserted, distinctly and loudly, that
those are fools who aver that God, the Omnipotent Creator of the world,
was born of a woman." This was in allusion to the celebrated and
mysterious book, "De Tribus Impostoribus," in the authorship of which
Frederick was accused of having been concerned.</p>

<p>The pontiff had touched the right chord. The begging friars, in all
directions, added to the accusations. "He has spoken of the Host as a
mummery; he has asked how many gods might be made out of a corn-field; he
has affirmed that, if the princes of the world would stand by him, he
would easily make for mankind a better faith and a better rule of life;
he has laid down the infidel maxim that 'God expects not a man to believe
anything that cannot be demonstrated by reason.'" The opinion of
Christendom rose against Frederick; its sentiment of piety was shocked.
The pontiff proceeded to depose him, and offered his crown to Robert of
France.
<span class="side">Frederick uses his Saracen troops.</span>
 But the Mussulman troops of the emperor were too much for the
begging friars of the pope. His Saracens were marching across Italy in
all directions. The pontiff himself would have inevitably fallen into the
hands of his mortal enemy had he not found a deliverance in death, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1241. Frederick had declared that he would not respect his sacred person,
but, if victorious, would teach him the absolute supremacy of the
temporal power. It was plain that he had no intention of respecting a
religion which he had not hesitated to denounce as "a mere absurdity."</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the intention of Innocent&nbsp;IV.&mdash;who, after the
short pontificate of Celestine&nbsp;IV. and an interval, succeeded&mdash;he was
borne into the same policy by the irresistible force of circumstances.
The deadly quarrel with the emperor was renewed. To escape his wrath,
Innocent fled to France, and there in safety called the Council of Lyons.
In a sermon, he renewed all the <span class="pag">[72]</span> old <a id="accusations72"></a>accusations&mdash;the heresy and
sacrilege&mdash;the peopling of Italian cities with Saracens, for the purpose
of overturning the Vicar of Christ with those infidels&mdash;the friendship
with the Sultan of Egypt&mdash;the African courtesans&mdash;the perjuries and
blasphemies.
<span class="side">Excommunication of Frederick.</span>
 Then was proclaimed the sentence of excommunication and
deposition. The pope and the bishops inverted the torches they held in
their hands until they went out, uttering the malediction, "So may he be
extinguished." Again the emperor appealed to Europe, but this time in
vain. Europe would not forgive him his blasphemy. Misfortunes crowded
upon him; his friends forsook him; his favourite son, Enzio, was taken
prisoner; and he never smiled again after detecting his intimate, Pietro
de Vinea, whom he had raised from beggary, in promising the monks that he
would poison him. The day had been carried by a resort to all means
justifiable and unjustifiable, good and evil. For thirty years Frederick
had combated the Church and the Guelph party, but he sunk in the conflict
at last. When Innocent heard of the death of his foe, he might doubtless
well think that what he had once asserted had at last become true: "We
are no mere mortal man; we have the place of God upon earth."
<span class="side"> The triumph at his death.</span>
In his
address to the clergy of Sicily he exclaimed, "Let the heavens rejoice
and let the earth be glad; for the lightning and tempest wherewith God
Almighty has so long menaced your heads have been changed by the death of
this man into refreshing zephyrs and fertilizing dews." This is that
superhuman vengeance which hesitates not to strike the corpse of a man.
Rome never forgives him who has told her of her impostures face to face;
she never forgives him who has touched her goods.</p>


<p><span class="side">Power of the Church at this moment.</span>
The  Saracenic influences had thus found an expression in the South of
France and in Sicily, involving many classes of society, from the Poor
Men of Lyons to the Emperor of Germany; but in both places they were
overcome by the admirable organization and unscrupulous vigour of the
Church. She handled her weapons with singular dexterity, and contrived to
extract victory out of humiliation and defeat. As always since the days
of Constantine, she had partisans <span class="pag">[73]</span> in <a id="every73"></a>every city, in every village, in
every family. And now it might have appeared that the blow she had thus
delivered was final, and that the world, in contentment, must submit to
her will. She had again succeeded in putting her iron heel on the neck of
knowledge, had invoked against it the hatred of Christendom, and reviled
it as the monstrous but legitimate issue of the detested Mohammedanism.</p>


<p><span class="side">Vitality of Frederick's principles.</span>But the fate of men is by no means an indication of the fate of
principles. The fall of the Emperor Frederick was not followed by the
destruction of the influences he represented. These not only survived
him, but were destined, in the end, to overcome the power which had
transiently overthrown them. We are now entering on the history of a
period which offers not only exterior opposition to the current
doctrines, but, what is more ominous, interior mutiny. Notwithstanding
the awful persecutions in the South of France&mdash;notwithstanding the
establishment of auricular confession as a detective means, and the
Inquisition as a weapon of punishment&mdash;notwithstanding the influence of
the French king, St. Louis, canonized by the grateful Church&mdash;heresy,
instead of being extirpated, extended itself among the laity, and even
spread among the ecclesiastical ranks.
<span class="side">St. Louis.</span>
St. Louis, the representative of
the hierarchical party, gathers influence only from the circumstance of
his relations with the Church, of whose interests he was a fanatical
supporter. So far as the affairs of his people were concerned, he can
hardly be looked upon as anything better than a simpleton. His reliance
for checking the threatened spread of heresy was a resort to
violence&mdash;the faggot and the sword. In his opinion, "A man ought never to
dispute with a misbeliever except with his sword, which he ought to drive
into the heretic's entrails as far as he can." It was the signal glory of
his reign that he secured for France that inestimable relic, the crown of
thorns.
<span class="side">His superstition,</span>
 This peerless memento of our Saviour's passion he purchased in
Constantinople for an immense sum. But France was doubly and enviably
enriched; for the Abbey of St. Denys was in possession of another, known
to be equally authentic! Besides the crown, he also secured the sponge
that <span class="pag">[74]</span> was <a id="dipped74"></a>dipped in vinegar; the lance of the Roman soldier; also the
swaddling-clothes in which the Saviour had first lain in the manger; the
rod of Moses; and part of the skull of John the Baptist. These treasures
he deposited in the "Holy Chapel" of Paris.</p>


<p><span class="side">and crusade. </span>Under the papal auspices, St. Louis determined on a crusade; and nothing,
except what we have already mentioned, can better show his mental
imbecility than his disregard of all suitable arrangements for it. He
thought that, provided the troops could be made to lead a religious life,
all would go well; that the Lord would fight his own battles, and that no
provisions of a military or worldly kind were needed. In such a pious
reliance on the support of God, he reached Egypt with his expedition in
June, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1249. The ever-conspicuous valour of the French troops could
maintain itself in the battle-field, but not against pestilence and
famine.
<span class="side">Its total failure.</span>
In March of the following year, as might have been foreseen, King
Louis was the prisoner of the Sultan, and was only spared the indignity
of being carried about as a public spectacle in the Mohammedan towns by a
ransom, at first fixed at a million of Byzantines, but by the merciful
Sultan voluntarily reduced one fifth. Still, for a time, Louis lingered
in the East, apparently stupefied by considering how God could in this
manner have abandoned a man who had come to his help. Never was there a
crusade with a more shameful end.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Inquisition attempts to arrest the intellectual revolt.</span>Notwithstanding the support of St. Louis in his own dominions, the
intellectual revolt spread in every direction, and that not only in
France, but throughout all Catholic Europe. In vain the Inquisition
exerted all its terrors&mdash;and what could be more terrible than its form of
procedure? It sat in secret; no witness, no advocate was present; the
accused was simply informed that he was charged with heresy, it was not
said by whom. He was made to swear that he would tell the truth as
regarded himself, and also respecting other persons, whether parents,
children, friends, strangers. If he resisted he was committed to a
solitary dungeon, dark and poisonous; his food was diminished; everything
was done to drive him into insanity. <span class="pag">[75]</span> Then <a id="the75"></a>the familiars of the Holy
Office, or others in its interests, were by degrees to work upon him to
extort confession as to himself or accusations against others. But this
fearful tribunal did not fail to draw upon itself the indignation of men.
Its victims, condemned for heresy, were perishing in all directions. The
usual apparatus of death, the stake and faggots, had become unsuited to
its wholesale and remorseless vengeance. The convicts were so numerous as
to require pens made of stakes and filled with straw.
<span class="side">Burnings of heretics.</span>
It was thus that,
before the Archbishop of Rheims and seventeen other prelates, one hundred
and eighty-three heretics, together with their pastor, were burned alive.
Such outrages against humanity cannot be perpetrated without bringing in
the end retribution. In other countries the rising indignation was
exasperated by local causes; in England, for instance, by the continual
intrusion of Italian ecclesiastics into the richest benefices. Some of
them were mere boys; many were non-residents; some had not so much as
seen the country from which they drew their ample wealth. The Archbishop
of York was excommunicated, with torches and bells, because he would not
bestow the abundant revenues of his Church on persons from beyond the
Alps; but for all this "he was blessed by the people." The archbishopric
of Canterbury was held, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1241, by Boniface of Savoy, to whom had been
granted by the pope the first-fruits of all the benefices in his
province. His rapacity was boundless. From all the ecclesiastics and
ecclesiastical establishments under his control he extorted enormous
sums. Some, who, like the Dean of St. Paul's, resisted him, were
excommunicated; some, like the aged Sub-prior of St. Bartholomew's, were
knocked down by his own hand. Of a military turn&mdash;he often wore a cuirass
under his robes&mdash;he joined his brother, the Archbishop of Lyons, who was
besieging Turin, and wasted the revenues of his see in England in
intrigues and petty military enterprises against his enemies in Italy.</p>

<p><span class="side">Mutiny arising in the Church.</span>Not among the laity alone was there indignation against such a state of
things. Mutiny broke out in the ranks of the Church. It was not that
among the humbler classes the sentiment of piety <span class="pag">[76]</span> had <a id="become76"></a>become
 diminished. <span class="side">The Shepherds and Flagellants.</span>
The Shepherds, under the leadership of the Master of Hungary, passed by
tens of thousands through France to excite the clergy to arouse for the
rescue of good King Louis, in bondage among the Mussulmen. They asserted
that they were commissioned by the Virgin, and were fed miraculously by
the Master. Originating in Italy, the Flagellants also passed, two by
two, through every city, scourging themselves for thirty-three days in
memory of the years of our Lord. These dismal enthusiasts emulated each
other, and were rivals of the mendicant friars in their hatred of the
clergy.
<span class="side">The mendicant friars are affected.</span>
 The mendicants were beginning to justify that hesitation which
Innocent displayed when he was first importuned to authorize them. The
papacy had reaped from these orders much good; it was now to gather a
fearful evil. They had come to be learned men instead of ferocious
bigots. They were now, indeed, among the most cultivated men of their
times. They had taken possession of many of the seats of learning. In the
University of Paris, out of twelve chairs of theology, three only were
occupied by the regular clergy. The mendicant friars had entered into the
dangerous paths of heresy. They became involved in that fermenting leaven
that had come from Spain, and among them revolt broke out.</p>


<p><span class="side">Rome prohibits the study of science.</span>With an unerring instinct, Rome traced the insurrection to its true
source. We have only to look at the measures taken by the popes to
understand their opinion. Thus Innocent&nbsp;III., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1215, regulated, by
his legate, the schools of Paris, permitting the study of the Dialectics
of Aristotle, but forbidding his physical and metaphysical works and
their commentaries. These had come through an Arabic channel. A rescript
of Gregory XI., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1231, interdicts those on natural philosophy until
they had been purified by the theologians of the Church. These
regulations were confirmed by Clement&nbsp;IV. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1265.</p>

<p><span class="side">"The Everlasting Gospel."</span>About <span class="pag">[77]</span> the close of the twelfth century appeared among the mendicant
friars that ominous work, which, under the title of "The Everlasting
Gospel," struck terror into the Latin hierarchy. It was affirmed that an
angel had brought it from heaven, engraven on copper plates, and had
given it to a priest called Cyril, who delivered it to the Abbot Joachim.
<span class="side">Introduction to it by the General of the Franciscans.</span>
The abbot had been dead about fifty years, when there was put
 forth, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1250,
 a true exposition of the tendency of his book, under the form of an
introduction, by John of Parma, the general of the <span class="pag">[78]</span> Franciscans, <a id="as78"></a>as was
universally suspected or alleged. Notwithstanding its heresy, the work
displayed an enlarged and masterly conception of the historical progress
of humanity. In this introduction, John of Parma pointed out that the
Abbot Joachim, who had not only performed a pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
but had been reverenced as a prophet, received as of unimpeachable
orthodoxy, and canonized, had accepted as his fundamental position that
Roman Christianity had done its work, and had now come to its inevitable
termination. He proceeded to show that there are epochs or ages in the
Divine government of the world; that, during the Jewish dispensation, it
had been under the immediate influence of God the Father; during the
Christian dispensation, it had been under that of God the Son; and that
the time had now arrived when it would be under the influence of God the
Holy Ghost; that, in the coming ages, there would be no longer any need
of faith, but that all things would be according to wisdom and reason. It
was the ushering in of a new time. So spake, with needful obscurity, the
Abbot Joachim, and so, more plainly, the General of the Franciscans in
his Introduction. "The Everlasting Gospel" was declared by its adherents
to have supplanted the New Testament, as that had supplanted the
Old&mdash;these three books constituting a threefold revelation, answering to
the Trinity of the Godhead. At once there was a cry from the whole
hierarchy.
<span class="side">Attempts to destroy the book.</span>
The Pope, Alexander&nbsp;IV., without delay, took measures for the
destruction of the book. Whoever kept or concealed a copy was
excommunicated. But among the lower mendicants&mdash;the Spiritualists, as
they were termed&mdash;the work was held in the most devout repute. With them
it had taken the place of the Holy Scriptures.
<span class="side">The Comment on the Apocalypse. </span>
So far from being
suppressed, it was followed, in about forty years, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1297, by the
Comment on the Apocalypse, by John Peter Oliva, who, in Sicily, had
accepted the three epochs or ages, and divided the middle one&mdash;the
Christian&mdash;into seven stages: the age of the Apostles; that of the
Martyrs; that of Heresies; that of Hermits; that of the Monastic System;
that of the overthrow of Anti-Christ, and that of the coming Millennium.
He agreed with <span class="pag">[79]</span> his <a id="predecessors79"></a>predecessors in the impending abolition of Roman
Christianity, stigmatized that Church as the purple harlot, and with them
affirmed that the pope and all his hierarchy had become superfluous and
obsolete&mdash;"their work was done, their doom sealed."
<span class="side">Spread of these doctrines among ecclesiastics.</span>
His zealous followers
declared that the sacraments of the Church were now all useless, those
administering them having no longer any jurisdiction. The burning of
thousands of these "Fratricelli" by the Inquisition was altogether
inadequate to suppress them. Eventually, when the Reformation occurred,
they mingled among the followers of Luther.</p>

<p><span class="side">Approaching difficulties of the Church.</span>To the internal and doctrinal troubles thus befalling the Church,
material and foreign ones of the most vital importance were soon added.
The true reason of the difficulties into which the papacy was falling was
now coming conspicuously into light. It was absolutely necessary that
money should be drawn to Rome, and the sovereigns of the Western
kingdoms, France and England, from which it had hitherto been largely
obtained, were determined that it should be so no longer. They had
equally urgent need themselves of all that could be extorted. In France,
even by St. Louis, it was enacted that the papal power in the election of
the clergy should be restrained; and, complaining of the drain of money
from the kingdom to Rome, he applied the effectual remedy of prohibiting
any such assessments or taxations for the future.</p>


<p><span class="side">Peter Morrone becomes pope.</span>We have now reached the pontificate of Boniface&nbsp;VIII., an epoch in the
intellectual history of Europe. Under the title of Celestine&nbsp;V. a
visionary hermit had been raised to the papacy&mdash;visionary, for Peter
Morrone (such was his name) had long been indulged in apparitions of
angels and the sounds of phantom bells in the air. Peter was escorted
from his cell to his supreme position by admiring crowds; but it very
soon became apparent that the life of an anchorite is not a preparation
for the duties of a pope. The conclave of cardinals had elected him, not
from any impression of his suitableness, but because they were evenly
balanced in two parties, neither of which would give way. They were <span class="pag">[80]</span>
therefore <a id="driven80"></a>driven to a temporary and available election. But scarcely had
this been done when his incapacity became conspicuous and his removal
imperative.
<span class="side">Celestine&nbsp;V. terrified into abdication.</span>
 It is said that the friends of Benedetto Gaetani, the ablest
of the cardinals, through a hole perforated in the pope's chamber wall,
at midnight, in a hollow voice, warned him that he retained his dignity
at the peril of his soul, and in the name of God commanded him to
abdicate. And so, in spite of all importunity, he did. His abdication was
considered by many pious persons as striking a death-blow at papal
infallibility.</p>


<p><span class="side">The miracle of Loretto.</span>It was during his pontificate that the miracle of Loretto occurred. The
house inhabited by the Virgin immediately after her conception had been
converted on the death of the Holy Family into a chapel, and St. Luke had
presented to it an image, carved by his own hands, still known as our
Lady of Loretto. Some angels chancing to be at Nazareth when the Saracen
conquerors approached, fearing that the sacred relic might fall into
their possession, took the house bodily in their hands, and, carrying it
through the air, after several halts, finally deposited it at Loretto in
Italy.</p>


<p><span class="side">Boniface&nbsp;VIII. elected pope.</span>So Benedetto Gaetani, whether by such wily procurements or not, became
Pope Boniface&nbsp;VIII., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1294. His election was probably due to King
Charles, who held twelve electoral votes, the bitter personal animosity
of the Colonnas having been either neutralized or overcome. The first
care of Boniface was to consolidate his power and relieve himself of a
rival. In the opinion of many it was not possible for a pope to abdicate.
Confinement in prison soon (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1296) settled that question.
<span class="side"> Ascent of Pope Celestine to heaven. </span>
 The soul of Celestine was seen by a monk ascending the skies, which opened to receive
it into heaven; and a splendid funeral informed his enemies that they
must now acknowledge Boniface as the unquestioned pope.
<span class="side">Quarrel of Boniface and the Colonnas.</span>
But the princely Colonnas, the leaders of the Ghibelline faction in Rome, who had resisted
the abdication of Celestine to the last, and were, therefore, mortal
enemies of Boniface, revolted. He published a bull against them; he
excommunicated them. With an ominous <span class="pag">[81]</span> anticipation <a id="of81"></a>of the future&mdash;for
they were familiar with the papal power, and knew where to touch it to
the quick&mdash;they appealed to a "General Council." Since supernatural
weapons did not seem to avail, Boniface proclaimed a crusade against
them. The issue answered his expectations. Palestrina, one of their
strongholds, which in a moment of weakness they had surrendered, was
utterly devastated and sown with salt. The Colonnas fled, some of them to
France. There, in King Philip the Fair, they found a friend, who was
destined to avenge their wrongs, and to inflict on the papacy a blow from
which it never recovered.</p>

<p><span class="side">Pecuniary necessities of Rome.</span>This was the state of affairs at the commencement of the quarrel between
Philip and Boniface. The Crusades had brought all Europe under taxation
to Rome, and loud complaints were everywhere made against the drain of
money into Italy. Things had at last come to such a condition that it was
not possible to continue the Crusades without resorting to a taxation of
the clergy, and this was the true reason of the eventual lukewarmness,
and even opposition to them. But the stream of money that had thus been
passing into Italy had engendered habits of luxury and extravagance. Cost
what it might, money must be had in Rome. The perennial necessity under
which the kings of England and France found themselves&mdash;the necessity of
revenue for the carrying out of their temporal projects&mdash;could only be
satisfied in the same way. The wealth of those nations had insensibly
glided into the hands of the Church.
<span class="side">The King of England compels the clergy to pay taxes.</span>
In England, Edward&nbsp;I. enforced the
taxation of the clergy. They resisted at first, but that sovereign found
an ingenious and effectual remedy. He directed his judges to hear no
cause in which an ecclesiastic was a complainant, but to try every suit
brought against them; asserting that those who refused to share the
burdens of the state had no right to the protection of its laws. They
forthwith submitted. In the nature and efficacy of this remedy we for the
first time recognize the agency of a class of men soon to rise to
power&mdash;the lawyers.</p>


<p><span class="side">The King of France attempts it.</span>In France, Philip the Fair made a similar attempt. It was not to be
supposed that Rome would tolerate <span class="pag">[82]</span> this <a id="trespassing82"></a>trespassing on what she
considered her proper domain, and accordingly Boniface issued the bull
"<i>Clericis laicos</i>," excommunicating kings who should levy subsidies on
ecclesiastics. Hereupon Philip determined that, if the French clergy were
not tributary to him, France should not be tributary to the pope, and
issued an edict prohibiting the export of gold and silver from France
without his license. But he did not resort to these extreme measures
until he had tried others which perhaps he considered less troublesome.
He had plundered the Jews, confiscated their property, and expelled them
from his dominions.
<span class="side"> Is abetted by the begging friars, </span>
The Church was fairly next in order; and, indeed, the
mendicant friars of the lower class, who, as we have seen, were
disaffected by the publication of "The Everlasting Gospel," were loud in
their denunciations of her wealth, attributing the prevailing religious
demoralization to it. They pointed to the example of our Lord and his
disciples; and when their antagonists replied that even He condescended
to make use of money, the malignant fanatics maintained their doctrines,
amid the applause of a jeering populace, by answering that it was not St.
Peter, but Judas, who was intrusted with the purse, and that the pope
stood in need of the bitter rebuke which Jesus had of old administered to
his prototype Peter, saying, "Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou
savourest not of the things that be of God, but of the things that be of
men" (Mark&nbsp;viii.&nbsp;33). Under that authority they affirmed that they might
stigmatize the great culprit without guilt. So the king ventured to put
forth his hand and touch what the Church had, and she cursed him to his
face. At first a literary war ensued: the pope published his bull, the
king his reply.
<span class="side">and ably sustained by the lawyers. </span>
 Already the policy which Philip was following, and the
ability he was displaying, manifested that he had attached to himself
that new power of which the King of England had taken advantage&mdash;a power
soon to become the mortal enemy of the ecclesiastic&mdash;the lawyers.
<span class="side">Device of the jubilee.</span>
 In the
meantime, money must be had in Rome; when, by the singularly felicitous
device of the proclamation of a year of jubilee, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1300, large sums
were again brought into Italy.</p>


<p><span class="side">The four enemies of Boniface. </span> <span class="pag">[83]</span> <a id="Boniface83"></a>Boniface had thus four
 antagonists on his hands&mdash;the King of France, the
Colonnas, the lawyers, and the mendicants. By the latter, both high and
low, he was cordially hated. Thus the higher English Franciscans were
enraged against him because he refused to let them hold lands. They
attempted to bribe him with 40,000 ducats; but he seized the money at the
banker's, under the pretence that it had no owners, as the mendicants
were vowed to poverty, and then denied the privilege. As to the lower
Franciscans, heresy was fast spreading among them. They were not only
infected with the doctrines of "The Everlasting Gospel," but had even
descended into the abyss of irreligion one step more by placing St.
Francis in the stead of our Saviour. They were incessantly repeating in
the ears of the laity that the pope was Anti-Christ, "The Man of Sin."
<span class="side">Collision between the French king and the pope.</span>
 The quarrel between Philip and Boniface was every moment increasing in
bitterness. The former seized and imprisoned a papal nuncio, who had been
selected because he was known to be personally offensive; the latter
retaliated by the issue of bulls protesting against such an outrage,
interfering between the king and his French clergy, and citing the latter
to appear in Rome and take cognizance of their master's misdoings. The
monarch was actually invited to be present and hear his own doom. In the
lesser bull&mdash;if it be authentic&mdash;and the king's rejoinder, both parties
seem to have lost their temper.
<span class="side"> The bull "<i>Ausculta Fili</i>." </span>
  This was followed by the celebrated bull
"<i>Ausculta Fili</i>" at which the king's indignation knew no bounds. He had
it publicly burnt in Paris at the sound of a trumpet; assembled the
States-General; and, under the advice of his lawyers, skilfully brought
the issue to this: Does the king hold the realm of France of God or of
the pope? Without difficulty it might be seen how the French clergy would
be compelled to act: since many of them held fiefs of the king, all were
in fear of the intrusion of Italian ecclesiastics into the rich
benefices. France, therefore, supported her monarch.
<span class="side">The bull "<i>Unam Sanctam</i>."</span>
 On his side, Boniface, in the bull "<i>Unam Sanctam</i>" asserted his power by declaring
that it is necessary to salvation to believe <span class="pag">[84]</span> that "every <a id="human84"></a>human being is
subject to the Pontiff of Rome." Philip, foreseeing the desperate nature
of the approaching conflict, and aiming to attach his people firmly to
him by putting himself forth as their protector against priestly tyranny,
again skilfully appealed to their sentiments by denouncing the
Inquisition as an atrocious barbarity, an outrage on human rights,
violating all law, resorting to new and unheard-of tortures, and doing
deeds at which men's minds revolt with horror. In the South of France
this language was thoroughly understood.
<span class="side">William de Nogaret. </span>
 The lawyers, among whom William
de Nogaret was conspicuous, ably assisted him; indeed, his whole movement
exhibited the extraordinary intelligence of his advisers. It has been
affirmed, and is, perhaps, not untrue, that De Nogaret's father had been
burnt by the Inquisition. The great lawyer was bent on revenge.
<span class="side">Action of the States-General. </span>
 The States-General, under his suggestions, entertained four propositions: 1.&nbsp;That
 Boniface was not the true pope; 2.&nbsp;That he was a heretic; 3.&nbsp;That he
was a simoniac; 4.&nbsp;That he was a man weighed down with crimes. De
Nogaret, learning from the Colonnas how to touch the papacy in a vital
point, demanded that the whole subject should be referred to a "General
Council" to be summoned by the king. A second meeting of the
States-General was held. William de Plaisian, the Lord of Vezenoble,
appeared with charges against the pope.
<span class="side">Accusations against the pope.</span>
  Out of a long list, many of which
could not possibly be true, some may be mentioned: that Boniface neither
believed in the immortality nor incorruptibility of the soul, nor in a
life to come, nor in the real presence in the Eucharist; that he did not
observe the fasts of the Church&mdash;not even Lent; that he spoke of the
cardinals, monks, and friars as hypocrites; that the Holy Land had been
lost through his fault; that the subsidies for its relief had been
embezzled by him; that his holy predecessor, Celestine, through his
inhumanity had been brought to death; that he had said that fornication
and other obscene practices are no sin; that he was a Sodomite, and had
caused clerks to be murdered in his presence; that he had enriched
himself by simony; that his nephew's wife had borne him two illegitimate
sons. These, with other <span class="pag">[85]</span> still <a id="more85"></a>more revolting charges, were sworn to upon
the Holy Gospels. The king appealed to "a general council and to a
legitimate pope."</p>

<p>The quarrel had now become a mortal one. There was but one course for
Boniface to take, and he did take it. He excommunicated the king. He
deprived him of his throne, and anathematized his posterity to the fourth
generation. The bull was to be suspended in the porch of the Cathedral of
Anagni on September 8; but William de Nogaret and one of the Colonnas had
already passed into Italy. They hired a troop of banditti, and on
September 7 attacked the pontiff in his palace at Anagni. The doors of a
church which protected him were strong, but they yielded to fire. The
brave old man, in his pontifical robes, with his crucifix in one hand and
the keys of St. Peter in the other, sat down on his throne and confronted
his assailants. His cardinals had fled through a sewer.
<span class="side">His seizure by De Nogaret, and his death.</span>
So little reverence was there for God's vicar upon earth, that Sciarra Colonna
raised his hand to kill him on the spot; but the blow was arrested by De
Nogaret, who, with a bitter taunt, told him that here, in his own city,
he owed his life to the mercy of a servant of the King of France&mdash;a
servant whose father had been burnt by the Inquisition. The pontiff was
spared only to be placed on a miserable horse, with his face to the tail,
and led off to prison. They meant to transport him to France to await the
general council. He was rescued, returned to Rome, was seized and
imprisoned again. On the 11th of October he died.</p>

<p>Thus,after a pontificate of nine eventful years, perished Boniface&nbsp;VIII.
His history and his fate show to what a gulf Roman Christianity was
approaching. His successor, Benedict&nbsp;XI., had but a brief enjoyment of
power; long enough, however, to learn that the hatred of the King of
France had not died with the death of Boniface, and that he was
determined not only to pursue the departed pontiff's memory beyond the
grave, but also to effect a radical change in the papacy itself.
<span class="side">Poisoning of Benedict XI.</span>
 A basket of figs was presented to Benedict by a veiled female. She had brought
them, she said, from the Abbess of St. Petronilla. In an unguarded moment
the pontiff ate of them <span class="pag">[86]</span> without <a id="the86"></a>the customary precaution of having them
previously tasted. Alas! what was the state of morals in Italy? A
dysentery came on; in a few days he was dead. But the Colonnas had
already taught the King of France how one should work who desires to
touch the popedom; the event that had just occurred was the preparation
for putting their advice into operation.
<span class="side">Understanding between the king and the Archbishop of Bordeaux. </span>
  The king came to an understanding with Bernard de Goth, the Archbishop of Bordeaux. Six
conditions were arranged between them: 1. The reconciliation between the
Church and the king; 2. The absolution of all persons engaged in the
affair of Boniface; 3. Tenths from the clergy for five years; 4. The
condemnation of the memory of Boniface; 5. The restoration of the
Colonnas; 6. A secret article; what it was time soon showed. A swift
messenger carried intelligence to the king's partisans in the College of
Cardinals, and Bernard became Clement&nbsp;V. "It will be long before we see
the face of another pope in Rome!" exclaimed the Cardinal Matteo Orsini,
with a prophetic instinct of what was coming when the conspiracy reached
its development.
<span class="side">Removal of the papacy to Avignon.</span>
 His prophecy was only too true. Now appeared what was
that sixth, that secret article negotiated between King Philip and De
Goth. Clement took up his residence at Avignon in France. The tomb of the
apostles was abandoned. The Eternal City had ceased to be the metropolis
of Christianity.</p>

<p>But a French prelate had not bargained with a French king for the most
eminent dignity to which a European can aspire without having given an
equivalent. In as good faith as he could to his contract, in as good
faith as he could to his present pre-eminent position, Clement&nbsp;V.
proceeded to discharge his share of the obligation. To a certain extent
King Philip was animated by an undying vengeance against his enemy, whom
he considered as having escaped out of his grasp, but he was also
actuated by a sincere desire of accomplishing a reform in the Church
through a radical change in its constitution.
<span class="side">Post-mortem trial of Pope Boniface.</span>
 He was resolved that the
pontiffs should be accountable to the kings of France, or that France
should more directly influence their conduct. To reconcile men to this,
it was for <span class="pag">[87]</span> him <a id="to87"></a>to show, with the semblance of pious reluctance, what was
the state to which morals and faith had come in Rome. The trial of the
dead Boniface was therefore entered upon, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1310. The Consistory was
opened at Avignon, March 18. The proceedings occupied many months; many
witnesses were examined.
<span class="side">The accusations against him.</span>
The main points attempted to be established by
their evidence seem to have been these: "That Boniface had declared his
belief that there was no such thing as divine law&mdash;what was reputed to be
such was merely the invention of men to keep the vulgar in awe by the
terrors of eternal punishment; that it was a falsehood to assert the
Trinity, and fatuous to believe it; that it was falsehood to say that a
virgin had brought forth, for it was an impossibility; that it was
falsehood to assert that bread is transubstantiated into the body of
Christ; that Christianity is false, because it asserts a future life, of
which there is no evidence save that of visionary people." It was in
evidence that the pope had said, "God may do the worst with me that he
pleases in the future life; I believe as every educated man does, the
vulgar believe otherwise. We have to speak as they do, but we must
believe and think with the few." It was sworn to by those who had heard
him disputing with some Parisians that he had maintained "that neither
the body nor the soul rise again." Others testified that "he neither
believed in the resurrection nor in the sacraments of the Church, and had
denied that carnal gratifications are sins." The Primicerio of St. John's
at Naples, deposed that, when a cardinal, Boniface had said in his
presence, "So that God gives me the good things of this life, I care not
a bean for that to come. A man has no more a soul than a beast. Did you
ever see any one who had risen from the dead?" He took delight in
deriding the blessed Virgin; "for," said he, "she was no more a virgin
than my mother." As to the presence of Christ in the Host, "It is nothing
but paste." Three knights of Lucca testified that when certain venerable
ambassadors, whose names they gave, were in the presence of the pope at
the time of the jubilee, and a chaplain happened to invoke the mercy of
Jesus on a person recently dead, Boniface appalled <span class="pag">[88]</span> all <a id="around88"></a>around him by
exclaiming, "What a fool, to commend him to Christ! He could not help
himself, and how can he be expected to help others? He was no Son of God,
but a shrewd man and a great hypocrite." It might seem impossible to
exceed such blasphemy: and yet the witnesses went on to testify to a
conversation which he held with the brave old Sicilian admiral, Roger
Loria. This devout sailor made the remark, in the pope's presence, that
if, on a certain occasion, he had died, it was his trust that Christ
would have had mercy on him. To this Boniface replied, "Christ! he was no
Son of God; he was a man, eating and drinking like ourselves; he never
rose from the dead; no man has ever risen. I am far mightier than he. I
can bestow kingdoms and humble kings." Other witnesses deposed to having
heard him affirm, "There is no harm in simony. There is no more harm in
adultery than in rubbing one's hands together." Some testified to such
immoralities and lewdness in his private life that the pages of a modern
book cannot be soiled with the recital.</p>


<p><span class="side">Philip consents to abstain from the prosecution.</span>In the meantime, Clement did all in his power to save the blackened
memory of his predecessor. Every influence that could be brought to bear
on the revengeful or politic king was resorted to, and at last with
success. Perhaps Philip saw that he had fully accomplished his object. He
had no design to destroy the papacy. His aim was to revolutionize it&mdash;to
give the kings of France a more thorough control over it; and, for the
accomplishment of that purpose, to demonstrate to what a condition it had
come through the present system. Whatever might be the decision, such
evidence had been brought forward as, notwithstanding its contradictions
and apparent inconsistencies, had made a profound impression on every
thinking man. It was the king's consummate policy to let the matter
remain where it was. Accordingly, he abandoned all farther action. The
gratitude of Clement was expressed in a bull exalting Philip, attributing
his action to piety, exempting him from all blame, annulling past bulls
prejudicial to him, revoking all punishments of those who had been
concerned against Boniface except in the case of fifteen persons, on <span class="pag">[89]</span> whom
a <a id="light89"></a>light and nominal penance was inflicted. In November, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1311, the
Council of Vienne met. In the following year three cardinals appeared
before it to defend the orthodoxy and holy life of Pope Boniface. Two
knights threw down their gauntlets to maintain his innocence by wager of
battle. There was no accuser! no one took up the gage; and the council
was at liberty quietly to dispose of the matter.</p>


<p><span class="side">The religious condition of Pope Boniface.</span>How far the departed pontiff was guilty of the charges alleged against
him was, therefore, never fairly ascertained. But it was a tremendous, an
appalling fact that charges of such a character could be even so much as
brought forward, much more that a succeeding pontiff had to listen to
them, and attribute intentions of piety to the accuser. The immoralities
of which Boniface was accused were such as in Italy did not excite the
same indignation as among the more moral people beyond the Alps; the
heresies were those everywhere pervading the Church. We have already seen
what a profound impression "The Everlasting Gospel" had made, and how
many followers and martyrs it had. What was alleged against Boniface was
only that he had taken one step more in the downward course of
irreligion. His fault lay in this, that in an evil hour he had given
expression to thoughts which, considering his position, ought to have
remained locked up in his inmost soul. As to the rest, if he was
avaricious, and accumulated enormous treasures, such as it was said the
banditti of the Colonnas seized when they outraged his person, he was no
worse than many other popes. Clement&nbsp;V., his successor, died enormously
rich; and, what was worse, did not hesitate to scandalize Europe by his
prodigal munificence to the beautiful Brunisard, the Countess of
Talleyrand, his lady.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its causes.</span>The religious condition of Boniface, though not admitting of apology, is
capable of explanation. By the Crusades all Europe had been wrought up to
a fanatical expectation, doomed necessarily to disappointment. From them
the papacy had derived prodigious advantages both in money and power. It
was now to experience fearful evils. It had largely promised rewards in
this life, and also in the world to come, <span class="pag">[90]</span> to <a id="those90"></a>those who would take up the
Cross; it had deliberately pitted Christianity against Mohammedanism, and
staked the authenticity of each on the issue of the conflict. In face of
the whole world it had put forth as the true criterion the possession of
the holy places, hallowed by the life, the sufferings, the death, the
resurrection of the Redeemer. Whatever the result might be, the
circumstances under which this had been done were such that there was no
concealing, no dissembling. In all Europe there was not a family which
had not been pecuniarily involved in the Crusades, perhaps few that had
not furnished men. Was it at all to be wondered at that everywhere the
people, accustomed to the logic of trial by battle, were terror-stricken
when they saw the result? Was it to be wondered at that even still more
dreadful heresies spontaneously suggested themselves? Was it at all
extraordinary that, if there had been popes sincerely accepting that
criterion, the issue should be a pope who was a sincere misbeliever? Was
it extraordinary that there should be a loss of papal prestige? It was
the papacy which had voluntarily, for its own ends, brought things into
this evil channel, and the papacy deserved a just retribution of
discredit and ruin. It had wrought on the devout temper of religious
Europe for its own sinister purposes; it had drained the Continent of its
blood, and perhaps of what was more highly prized&mdash;its money; it had
established a false issue, an unwarrantable criterion, and now came the
time for it to reap consequences of a different kind&mdash;intellectual revolt
among the people, heresy among the clergy. Nor was the pope without
eminent comrades in his sin.
<span class="side">Apostacy of the Templars.</span>
 The Templars, whose duty it had been to
protect pilgrims on the way to Jerusalem&mdash;who had therefore been long and
thoroughly familiar with the state of events in Palestine&mdash;had been
treading in the same path as the pope. Dark rumours had begun to
circulate throughout Europe that these, the very vanguard of
Christianity, had not only proved traitors to their banner, but had
actually become Mohammedanized. On their expulsion from the Holy Land, at
the close of the Crusades, they spread all over Europe, to disseminate by
stealth their fearful heresies, and to enjoy the riches <span class="pag">[91]</span> they <a id="had91"></a>had
acquired in the service they had betrayed. Men find a charm in having it
mysteriously and secretly divulged to them that their long-cherished
opinions are all a delusion. There was something fascinating in hearing
privately, from those who could speak with authority, that, after all,
Mohammed was not an impostor, but the author of a pure and noble Theism;
that Saladin was not a treacherous assassin, a despicable liar, but a
most valiant, courteous, and gentle knight. In his proceedings against
the Templars, King Philip the Fair seems to have been animated by a pure
intention of checking the disastrous spread of these opinions; yet
William de Nogaret, who was his chief adviser on this matter as on that
of Boniface, was not without reasons of personal hatred. It was said that
he divided his wrath between the Templars and the pope. They had had some
connexion with the burning of his father, and vengeance he was resolved
to wreak upon them.
<span class="side">They are arrested and tried.</span>
Under colour of the charges against them, all the
Templars in France were simultaneously arrested in the dawn of one day,
October 13, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1307, so well devised were the measures. The grand
master, Du Molay, was secured, not, however, without some perfidy. Now
were openly brought forward the charges which struck Europe with
consternation. Substantiation of them was offered by witnesses, but it
was secured by submitting the accused to torture. The grand master, Du
Molay, at first admitted their guilt of the crimes alleged. After some
hesitation, the pope issued a bull, commanding the King of England to do
what the King of France had already done, to arrest the Templars and
seize their property. His declaration, that one of the order, a man of
high birth, had confessed to himself his criminality, seems to have made
a profound impression on the mind of the English king, and of many other
persons until that time reluctant to believe. The Parliament and the
University of Paris expressed themselves satisfied with the evidence. New
examinations were held, and new convictions were made. The pope issued a
bull addressed to all Christendom, declaring how slowly, but, alas! how
certainly, he had been compelled to believe in the apostacy of the order,
and commanding that everywhere proceedings <span class="pag">[92]</span> should <a id="be92"></a>be instituted against
it. A papal commission assembled in Paris, August 7, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1309. The grand
master was brought before it. He professed his belief in the Catholic
faith, but now denied that the order was guilty of the charges alleged
against it, as also did many of the other knights. Other witnesses were,
however, brought forward, some of whom pretended to have abandoned the
order on account of its foul acts. At the Porte St. Antoine, on many
pleasant evenings in the following May, William de Nogaret revelled in
the luxury of avenging the shade of his father.
<span class="side">Found guilty and punished. </span>
One hundred and thirteen Templars were, in slow succession, burnt at stakes. The remorseless
lawyer was repaying the Church in her own coin. Yet of this vast
concourse of sufferers all died protesting their innocence; not one
proved an apostate. Notwithstanding this most significant fact&mdash;for those
who were ready to lay down their lives, and to meet with unshaken
constancy the fire, were surely the bravest of the knights, and their
dying declaration is worthy of our most reverent consideration&mdash;things
were such that no other course was possible than the abolition of the
order, and this accordingly took place. The pope himself seems to have
been satisfied that the crimes had been perpetrated under the instigation
or temptation of Satan; but men of more enlarged views appear to have
concluded that, though the Templars were innocent of the moral
abominations charged against them, a familiarity with other forms of
belief in the East had undoubtedly sapped their faith. After a weary
imprisonment of six years, embittered by many hardships, the grand
master, Du Molay, was brought up for sentence. He had been found guilty.
With his dying breath, "before Heaven and earth, on the verge of death,
when the least falsehood bears like an intolerable weight on the soul,"
he declared the innocence of the order and of himself.
<span class="side">Burning of Du Molay.</span>
The vesper-bell was sounding when Du Molay and a brother convict were led forth to their
stakes, placed on an island in the Seine. King Philip himself was
present. As the smoke and flames enveloped them they continued to affirm
their innocence. Some averred that forth from the fire Du Molay's voice
sounded, "Clement! thou wicked and false judge, I summon <span class="pag">[93]</span> thee <a id="to93"></a>to meet me
within forty days at the bar of God." Some said that he also summoned the
king. In the following year King Philip the Fair and Pope Clement the
Fifth were dead.</p>

<p>John XXII., elected after an interval of more than two years spent in
rivalries and intrigues between the French and Italian cardinals,
continued the residence at Avignon. His movements took a practical turn
in the commencement of a process for the recovery of the treasures of
Clement from the Viscount de Lomenie. This was only a part of the wealth
of the deceased pope, but it amounted to a million and three quarters of
florins of gold. The Inquisition was kept actively at work for the
extermination of the believers in "The Everlasting Gospel," and the
remnant of the Albigenses and Waldenses. But all this had no other result
than that which eventually occurred&mdash;an examination of the authenticity
and rightfulness of the papal power. With an instinct as to the origin of
the misbelief everywhere spreading, the pope published bulls against the
Jews, of whom a bloody persecution had arisen, and ordered that all their
Talmuds and other blasphemous books should be burnt.
<span class="side">Marsilio's work, "The Defender of Peace."</span>
 A physician, Marsilio of Padua, published a work, "The Defender of Peace." It was a
philosophical examination of the principles of government, and of the
nature and limits of the sacerdotal power. Its democratic tendency was
displayed by its demonstration that the exposition of the law of
Christianity rests not with the pope nor any other priest, but with a
general council; it rejected the papal political pretensions; asserted
that no one can be rightfully excommunicated by a pope alone, and that he
has no power of coercion over human thought; that the civil immunities of
the clergy ought to be ended; that poverty and humility ought alone to be
their characteristics; that society ought to provide them with a decent
sustenance, but nothing more: their pomp, extravagance, luxury, and
usurpations, especially that of tithes, should be abrogated; that neither
Christ nor the Scriptures ever gave St. Peter a supremacy over the other
apostles; that, if history is to be consulted, St. Paul, and not St.
Peter, was bishop of Rome&mdash;indeed, it is <span class="pag">[94]</span> doubtful <a id="whether94"></a>whether the latter was
ever in that city, the Acts of the Apostles being silent on that subject.
From these and many other such arguments he drew forty-one conclusions
adverse to the political and ecclesiastical supremacy of the pope.</p>



<p>It is not necessary to consider here the relations of John XXII. to Louis
of Bavaria, nor of the antipope Nicholas; they belong merely to political
history. But, as if to show how the intellectual movement was working its
way, the pontiff himself did not escape a charge of heresy.
<span class="side">The "beatific vision."</span>
 Though he had
so many temporal affairs on his hands, John did not hesitate to raise the
great question of the "beatific vision." In his opinion, the dead, even
the saints, do not enjoy the beatific vision of God until after the
Judgment-day. At once there was a demand among the orthodox, "What! do
not the apostles, John, Peter, nay, even the blessed Virgin, stand yet in
the presence of God?" The pope directed the most learned theologians to
examine the question, himself entering actively into the dispute. The
University of Paris was involved. The King of France declared that his
realm should not be polluted with such heretical doctrines. A single
sentence explains the practical direction of the dogma, so far as the
interests of the Church were concerned: "If the saints stand not in the
presence of God, of what use is their intercession? What is the use of
addressing prayers to them?" The folly of the pontiff perhaps might be
excused by his age. He was now nearly ninety years old. That he had not
guided himself according to the prevailing sentiment of the lower
religious orders, who thought that poverty is essential to salvation,
appeared at his death, A.D. 1334. He left eighteen millions of gold
florins in specie, and seven millions in plate and jewels.</p>


<p><span class="side">It is explained by Benedict&nbsp;XII.</span>His successor, Benedict&nbsp;XII., disposed of the question of the "beatific
vision:" "It is only those saints who do not pass through Purgatory that
immediately behold the Godhead." The pontificate of Benedict, which was
not without many good features, hardly verified the expression with which
he greeted the cardinals when they elected him, "You have chosen an ass."
<span class="pag">[95]</span> His <a id="was95"></a>was a gay life. There is a tradition that to him is due the origin
of the proverb, "As drunk as a pope."</p>


<p><span class="side">Voluptuousness of Avignon.</span>In the subsequent pontificate of Clement&nbsp;VI., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1342, the court at
Avignon became the most voluptuous in Christendom. It was crowded with
knights and ladies, painters and other artists. It exhibited a day-dream
of equipages and banquets. The pontiff himself delighted in female
society, but, in his weakness, permitted his lady, the Countess of
Turenne, to extort enormous revenues by the sale of ecclesiastical
promotions. Petrarch, who lived at Avignon at this time, speaks of it as
a vast brothel. His own sister had been seduced by the holy father, John&nbsp;XXII.
 During all these years the Romans had made repeated attempts to
force back the papal court to their city. With its departure all their
profits had gone. But the fatal policy of electing Frenchmen into the
College of Cardinals seemed to shut out every hope.
<span class="side">Rienzi.</span>
 The unscrupulous
manner in which this was done is illustrated by the fact that Clement
made one of his relatives, a lad of eighteen, a cardinal. For a time the
brief glories of Rienzi cast a flickering ray on Rome; but Rienzi was
only a demagogue&mdash;an impostor. It was the deep impression made upon
Europe that the residence at Avignon was an abandonment of the tomb of
St. Peter, that compelled Urban&nbsp;V. to return to Rome. This determination
was strengthened by a desire to escape out of the power of the kings of
France, and to avoid the free companies who had learned to extort bribes
for sparing Avignon from plunder. He left Avignon, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1367, amid the
reluctant grief of his cardinals, torn from that gay and dissipated city,
and in dread of the recollections and of the populace of Rome. And well
it might be so; for not only in Rome, but all over Italy, piety was held
in no respect, and the discipline of the Church in derision.
<span class="side">Irreverence of Barnabas Visconti.</span>
 When Urban
sent to Barnabas Visconti, who was raising trouble in Tuscany, a bull of
excommunication by the hands of two legates, Barnabas actually compelled
them, in his presence, to eat the parchment on which the bull was
written, together with the leaden seal and the silken string, and,
telling them that he hoped it would sit <span class="pag">[96]</span> as <a id="lightly96"></a>lightly on their stomachs as
it did on his, sent them back to their master! In a little time&mdash;it was
but two years&mdash;absence from France became insupportable; the pope
returned to Avignon, and there died.
<span class="side">The popes return to Rome.</span>
 It was reserved for his successor,
Gregory XI., finally to end what was termed, from its seventy years'
duration, the Babylonish captivity, and restore the papacy to the Eternal
City, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1376.</p>


<p><span class="side">Causes of the great schism.</span>But, though the popes had thus returned to Rome, the effects of King
Philip's policy still continued. On the death of Gregory XI., the
conclave, meeting at Rome&mdash;for the conclave must meet where the pope
dies&mdash;elected Urban&nbsp;VI., under intimidation of the Roman populace, who
were determined to retain the papacy in their city; but, escaping to
Fondi, and repenting of what they had thus done, they proclaimed his
election void, and substituted Clement&nbsp;VII. for him. They were actually
at one time on the point of choosing the King of France as pope. Thus
began the great schism. It was, in reality, a struggle between France and
Italy for the control of the papacy. The former had enjoyed it for
seventy years; the latter was determined to recover it. The schism thus
rested originally on political considerations, but these were doubtless
exasperated by the conduct of Urban, whose course was overbearing and
even intolerable to his supporters. Nor did he amend as his position
became more consolidated. In <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1385, suspecting his cardinals of an
intention to seize him, declare him a heretic, and burn him, he submitted
several of them to torture in his own presence, while he recited his
breviary. Escaping from Nocera, where he had been besieged, he caused the
Bishop of Aquila to be killed on the roadside. Others he tied in sacks,
and threw into the sea at Genoa. It was supposed, not without reason,
that he was insane.</p>


<p><span class="side">Pecuniary necessities of the rival popes.</span>If there had formerly been pecuniary difficulty in supporting one papal
court, it, of course, became greater now that there were two. Such
troubles, every day increasing, led at length to unhappy political
movements. There was an absolute necessity for drawing money to Rome and
also to Avignon. The device of a jubilee was too transitory and <span class="pag">[97]</span>
inadequate, <a id="even97"></a>even though, by an improvement in the theory of that
festival, it was expedited by thirty-three years, answering to our
Saviour's life. At Avignon, the difficulty of Clement, who was of amiable
and polished manners, turned on the French Church being obliged to
support him; and it is not to be wondered at that the French clergy
looked with dislike on the pontifical establishment among them, since it
was driven by its necessities to prey on all their best benefices.
<span class="side">Organization of simony.</span>
Under such circumstances, no other course was possible to the rival popes and
their successors than a thorough reorganization of the papal financial
system&mdash;the more complete development of simony, indulgences, and other
improper sources of emolument. In this manner Boniface&nbsp;IX. tripled the
value of the annates upon the papal books. Usurers or brokers,
intervening between the purchasers of benefices and the papal exchequer,
were established, and it is said that, under the pressing difficulties of
the case, benefices were known to have been sold, many times in
succession, to different claimants in one week. Late applicants might
obtain a preference for appointments on making a cash payment of
twenty-five florins; an increased preference might be had for fifty. It
became, at last, no unusual thing to write to kings and prelates for
subsidies&mdash;a proof how greatly the papacy had been weakened by the events
of the times.</p>


<p><span class="side">Indignation of religious Europe.</span>But religious Europe could not bear with such increasing scandals. The
rival popes were incessantly accusing each other of falsehood and all
manner of wickedness. At length the public sentiment found its expression
in the Council of Pisa, called by the cardinals on their own
responsibility. This council summoned the two popes&mdash;Benedict&nbsp;XIII. and
Gregory XII.&mdash;before it; declared the crimes and excesses imputed to them
to be true, and deposed them both, appointing in their stead Alexander&nbsp;V.
<span class="side">Three popes.</span>
There were now, therefore, three popes. But, besides thus rendering the
position of things worse than it was before in this respect, the council
had taken the still more extraordinary step of overthrowing the autocracy
of the pope. It had been compelled by the force of circumstances <span class="pag">[98]</span> to
<a id="destroy98"></a>destroy the very foundation of Latin Christianity by assuming the
position of superiority over the vicar of Christ. Now might be discerned
by men of reflexion the purely human nature of the papacy. It had broken
down. Out of the theological disputes of preceding years a political
principle was obviously emerging; the democratic spirit was developing
itself, and the hierarchy was in rebellion against its sovereign.</p>

<p>Nor was this great movement limited to the clergy. In every direction the
laity participated in it, pecuniary questions being in very many
instances the incentive. Things had come to such a condition that it
seemed to be of little moment what might be the personal character of the
pontiff; the necessities of the position irresistibly drove him to
replenish the treasury by shameful means.
<span class="side">Balthazar Cossa made pope. </span>
 Thus, on Alexander's death,
Balthazar Cossa, an evil but an able man, who succeeded as John XXIII.,
was not only compelled to extend the existing simoniacal practices of the
ecclesiastical brokers' offices, but actually to derive revenue from the
licensing of prostitutes, gambling-houses, and usurers.
<span class="side">Dissatisfaction in England.</span>
 In England, for
ages a mine of wealth to Rome, the tendency of things was shown by such
facts as the remonstrance of the Commons with the crown on the
appointment of ecclesiastics to all the great offices; the allegations
made by the "Good Parliament" as to the amount of money drawn by Rome
from the kingdom. They asserted that it was five times as much as the
taxes levied by the king, and that the pope's revenue from England was
greater than the revenue of any prince in Christendom. It was shown again
by such facts as the passage of the statutes of Mortmain, Provisors, and
Præmunire, and by the universal clamour against the mendicant orders.
This dissatisfaction with the clergy was accompanied by a desire for
knowledge.
<span class="side"> Wiclif, the English reformer. </span>
Thousands of persons crowded to the universities both on the
Continent and in England. In a community thus well prepared, Wiclif found
no difficulty in disseminating his views. He had adopted in many
particulars the doctrines of Berengar. He taught that the bread in the
Eucharist is not the real body of Christ, but only its image; that <span class="pag">[99]</span> the
<a id="Roman99"></a>Roman Church has no true claim to headship over other churches; that its
bishop has no more authority than any other bishop; that it is right to
deprive a delinquent Church of temporal possessions; that no bishop ought
to have prisons for the punishment of those obnoxious to him; and that
the Bible alone is a sufficient guide for a Christian man.
<span class="side">He translates the Bible. </span>
 His translation of the Bible into English was the practical carrying out of
that assertion for the benefit of his own countrymen. All classes of
society were becoming infected. The government for a season vacillated.
It was said that every other man in England was a Lollard. The Lollards
were Wiclifites. But the Church at last persuaded the government to let
her try her hand, and the statute "de heretico comburendo" was passed
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1400.
<span class="side">Burning of English heretics.</span>
William Sautree, a priest who had turned Wiclifite, was the
first English martyr. John Badbee, a tailor, who denied
transubstantiation&mdash;accused of having said that, if it were true, there
were 20,000 gods in every corn-field in England&mdash;next suffered in like
manner at the stake, in presence of the Prince of Wales. Lord Cobham, the
head of the Lollards, who had denounced the pope as Anti-Christ, the Son
of Perdition, was imprisoned; but escaping, became involved in political
movements, and suffered at length the double penalty for heresy and
treason, being hung on a gallows with a fire blazing at his feet. It is
interesting to remark the social rank of these three early martyrs.
Heresy was pervading all classes, from the lowest to the highest.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Council of Constance deposes the pope,</span>TheCouncil of Constance met <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1415. It had a threefold object: 1. The
union of the Church under one pope; 2. The reformation of the clergy; 3.
The suppression of heresy. Its policy from the first was determined. It
proclaimed itself supreme. It demanded the abdication of the pope John&nbsp;XXIII.;
exhibited articles of accusation against him, some of them of
such enormity as almost to surpass belief, and justifying the epithet
that he was "a devil incarnate." The suffrage of the council was changed.
The plan of voting by nations, which reduced the Italians to a single
vote, was introduced. These incidental facts <span class="pag">[100]</span> may <a id="indicate100"></a>indicate to us that
there were present men who understood thoroughly how to manage the
machinery of such an assembly, and that the remark of Æneas Sylvius,
afterward Pope Pius&nbsp;II., respecting the Council of Basle was equally true
as to that of Constance, that it was not so much directed by the Holy
Ghost as by the passions of men. The influence that lawyers were now
exercising in social affairs&mdash;their habits of arrangement, of business,
and intrigue, is strikingly manifested in the management of these
assemblages; their arts had passed to the clergy, and even in part to the
people. But how vast was the change that had occurred in the papacy from
the voluntary abdication of Celestine to the compulsory abdication of
John!</p>


<p><span class="side">and murders John Huss. </span>To this council, also, came John Huss, under a safe-conduct from the
Emperor Sigismund. Scarcely, however, had he arrived when he was
imprisoned; this treachery being excused from the necessity of conceding
it to the reforming party. On June 5th, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1416, Huss was brought in
chains before the council. It was declared unlawful to keep faith with a
heretic. His countrymen, the Bohemian lords present, protested against
such perfidy, and loudly demanded his release. Articles of accusation,
derived from his works, were presented. He avowed himself ready to defend
his opinions. The uproar was so great that the council temporarily
adjourned. Two days afterwards the trial was resumed. It was ushered in
by an eclipse of the sun, said to have been total at Prague. No one of
the bloodthirsty ecclesiastics laid to heart the solemn monition that,
after his moment of greatest darkness was over, the sun shone forth with
recovered effulgence again. The emperor was present, with all the
fathers. The first accusation entered on related to transubstantiation.
On this and on succeeding occasions the emperor took part in the
discussions, among other things observing that, in his opinion, the
prisoner was worthy of death. After a lengthy inquiry into his alleged
errors, a form of recantation was prepared for Huss.
<span class="side">Noble conduct of Huss.</span>
 With modest firmness
he declined it, concluding his noble answer with the words, "I appeal to
Christ Jesus, the one all-powerful and all-just Judge. To him I commend <span class="pag">[101]</span>
my <a id="cause101"></a>cause, who will judge every man, not according to false witnesses and
erring councils, but according to truth and man's desert." On July 1st
the council met in full session. Thirty articles against Huss were read.
Among other things, they alleged that he believed the material bread to
be unchanged after the consecration. In his extremity the prisoner looked
steadfastly at the traitor Sigismund, and solemnly exclaimed, "Freely
came I here under the safe-conduct of the emperor." The
conscience-stricken monarch blushed. Huss was then made to kneel down and
receive his sentence. It condemned his writings and his body to the
flames.</p>


<p><span class="side">He is burnt.</span>He was then degraded and despoiled of his orders. Some of the bishops
mocked at him; some, more merciful, implored him to recant. They cut his
hair in the form of a cross, and set upon his head a high paper crown on
which devils were painted. "We devote thy soul to the devils in hell."
"And I commend my soul to the most merciful Lord Christ Jesus." He was
then led forth. They passed by the bishop's palace, where Huss's books
were burning. When they fastened him with a chain to his stake, the
painted crown fell off, but the soldiers replaced it. "Let him and his
devils be burned together." As the flames closed over him, he chanted
psalms and prayed to the Redeemer. Can that be true which requires for
its support the murder of a true man?</p>


<p><span class="side">It murders, also, Jerome of Prague.</span>So acted without a dissenting voice the Council of Constance. It feared
the spread of heresy, but it did not fear, perhaps did not consider, that
higher tribunal to whose inexorable verdict councils, and popes, and
emperors must submit&mdash;posterity. It asserted itself to be under the
inspiration of the Holy Ghost. It took profit by a shameful perfidy. It
was a conclave of murderers. It stifled the voice of an earnest man,
solemnly protesting against a doctrine now derided by all the intellect
of Europe. The revolution it was compassing it inaugurated in blood, not
alone that of John Huss, but also of Jerome of Prague. These martyrs were
no common men.
<span class="side">His singular eloquence.</span>
Poggio Bracciolini, an eye-witness, says, in a letter to
Leonardo Aretino, speaking of the eloquence of Jerome, "When I consider
what his choice of words <span class="pag">[102]</span> was, <a id="what102"></a>what his elocution, what his reasoning,
what his countenance, his voice, his action I must affirm, however much
we may admire the ancients, that in such a cause no one could have
approached nearer to the model of their eloquence."</p>

<p>John&nbsp;XXIII. was compelled to abdicate. Gregory&nbsp;XII. died. Some time
after, Benedict&nbsp;XIII. followed him. The council had elected Martin&nbsp;V.,
and in him found a master who soon put an end to its doings.
<span class="side">What the council did.</span>
 It had deposed one pope and elected another; it had cemented the dominant creed
with blood; it had authorized the dreadful doctrine that a difference in
religious opinion justifies the breaking of plighted faith between man
and man; it had attempted to perpetuate its own power by enacting that
councils should be held every five years; but it had not accomplished its
great object&mdash;ecclesiastical reform.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Council of Basle.</span>In a room attached to the Cathedral of Basle, with its roof of green and
parti-coloured tiles, the modern traveller reads on a piece of paper this
inscription: "The room of the council, where the famous Council of Basil
was assembled. In this room Pope Eugene&nbsp;IV. was dethroned, and replaced
by Felix&nbsp;V., Duc of Savoie and Cardinal of Repaile. The council began
1431, and lasted 1448." That chamber, with its floor of little red
earthen flags and its oaken ceiling, witnessed great events.</p>

<p>The democratic influence pervading the Church showed no symptoms of
abatement. The fate of Huss had been avenged in blood and fire by the
Bohemian sword. Eugenius&nbsp;IV., now pontiff, was afraid that negotiations
would be entered upon with the Hussite chiefs. Such a treaty, he
affirmed, would be blasphemy against God and an insult to the pope. He
was therefore bent on the prorogation of the council, and spared no means
to accomplish his purpose. Its ostensible object was the reformation of
the clergy; its real intent was to convert the papal autocracy into a
constitutional monarchy.
<span class="side">It declares the pope in contumacy.</span>
 To this end it cited the pope, and, on his
non-appearance, declared him and seventeen of the cardinals in contumacy.
He had denounced it as the Synagogue of Satan; on its part, it was
assuming the functions of the <span class="pag">[103]</span> Senate <a id="of103"></a>of Christendom. It had prepared a
great seal, and asserted that, in case of the death of the pope, the
election of his successor was vested in it. It was its firm purpose never
again to leave that great event in the hands of a conclave of intriguing
Italian cardinals, but to intrust it to the representatives of united
Christendom. After a due delay since he was declared in contumacy, the
council suspended the pope, and, slowly moving towards its object,
elected Amadeus of Savoy, Felix&nbsp;V., his successor. It was necessary that
its pope should be a rich man, for the council had but slender means of
offering him pecuniary support. Amadeus had that qualification. And
perhaps it was far from being, in the eyes of many, an inopportune
circumstance that he had been married and had children.
<span class="side"> Its real intentions.</span>
 We may discern,
through the shifting scenes of the intrigues of the times, that the
German hierarchy had come to the resolution that the election of the
popes should be taken from the Italians and given to Europe; that his
power should be restricted; that he should no longer be the irresponsible
vicar of God upon earth; but the accountable chief executive officer of
Christendom; and that the right of marriage should be conceded to the
clergy. These are significantly Teutonic ideas.</p>


<p><span class="side">Cause and close of these troubles.</span>We have pursued the story of these events nearly as far as is necessary
for the purpose of this book. We shall not, therefore, follow the details
of the new schism. It fell almost without interest on Europe. Æneas
Sylvius, the ablest man of the day, in three words gives us the true
insight into the state of things: "Faith is dead." On the demise of
Eugenius&nbsp;IV., Nicolas&nbsp;V. succeeded. An understanding was had with those
in the interest of the council. It was dissolved. Felix&nbsp;V. abdicated. The
morality of the times had improved. The anti-pope was neither blinded nor
murdered. The schism was at an end.</p>


<p><span class="side">End of the intellectual influence of the papacy.</span>Thus we have seen that the personal immoralities and heresy of the popes
brought on the interference of the King of France, who not only shook the
papal system to its basis but destroyed its prestige by inflicting the
most conspicuous indignity upon it. For seventy years Rome was
disfranchised, <span class="pag">[104]</span> and <a id="the104"></a>the rivalries of France and Italy produced the great
schism, than which nothing could be more prejudicial to the papal power.
We have seen that, aided by the pecuniary difficulties of the papacy, the
rising intellect of Europe made good its influence and absolutely deposed
the pope. It was in vain to deny the authenticity of such a council;
there stood the accomplished fact. At this moment there seemed no other
prospect for the Italian system than utter ruin; yet, wonderful to be
said, a momentary deliverance came from a quarter whence no man would
have expected. The Turks were the saviours of the papacy.</p>

<p>At this point is the true end of the Italian system&mdash;that system which
had pressed upon Europe like a nightmare. The great men of the times&mdash;the
statesmen, the philosophers, the merchants, the lawyers, the governing
classes&mdash;those whose weight of opinion is recognized by the uneducated
people at last, had shaken off the incubus and opened their eyes. A
glimmering of the true state of things was breaking upon the clergy. No
more with the vigour it once possessed was the papacy again to domineer
over human thought and be the controlling agent of European affairs.
Convulsive struggles it might make, but they were only death-throes. The
sovereign pontiff must now descend from the autocracy he had for so many
ages possessed, and become a small potentate, tolerated by kings in that
subordinate position only because of the remnant of his influence on the
uneducated multitude and those of feeble minds.</p>

<p><span class="side">The Eastern pressure.</span> <span class="pag">[105]</span> From the West I have now to return to the East, and to describe the
pressure made by Mohammedanism on that side. It is illustrated by many
great events, but, above all, by the fall of Constantinople. The Greek
Church, so long out of sight that it is perhaps almost forgotten by the
reader, comes for a moment before us like a spectre from the dead.</p>


<p><span class="side">Invasions of the Turks.</span>A wandering tribe of Turks had found its way into Asia Minor, and, under
its leader Ertogrul and his son Othman, consolidated its power and
commenced extending its influence by possessions taken from the sultans
of Iconium and the Byzantine empire. The third prince of the race
instituted the <span class="pag">[106]</span> Janissaries, a <a id="remarkable106"></a>remarkable military force, and commenced
driving the Greeks out of Asia Minor. His son Soliman crossed the
Hellespont and captured Gallipoli, thus securing a foothold in Europe,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1358.</p>


<p><span class="side">Extension of their power in Europe.</span>This accomplished, the Turkish influence began to extend rapidly. Thrace,
Macedon, and Servia were subdued. Sigismund, the King of Hungary, was
overthrown at the battle of Nicopolis by Bajazet. Southern Greece, the
countries along the Danube, submitted, and Constantinople would have
fallen had it not been for the unexpected irruption of Tamerlane, who
defeated Bajazet and took him prisoner. The reign of Mohammed&nbsp;I., who
succeeded, was occupied in the restoration of Turkish affairs. Under
Amurath&nbsp;II., the possession of the Euxine shore was obtained, the
fortifications across the Isthmus of Corinth were stormed, and the
Peloponnesus entered.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Byzantine sovereigns apply to the West.</span>Mohammed&nbsp;II. became the Sultan of the Turks <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1451. From the moment of
his accession, he turned all his powers to the capture of Constantinople.
Its sovereigns had long foreseen the inevitable event, and had made
repeated attempts to secure military aid from the West. They were ready
to surrender their religious belief. On this principle, the monk Barlaam
was despatched on an embassy to Benedict&nbsp;XII. to propose the reunion of
the Greek and Latin Churches, as it was delicately termed, and to obtain,
as an equivalent for the concession, an army of Franks. As the danger
became more urgent, John Palæologus&nbsp;I. sought an interview with Urban&nbsp;V.,
and, having been purified from his heresies respecting the supremacy of
the pope and the double procession of the Holy Ghost, was presented
before the pontiff in the Church of St. Peter. The Greek monarch, after
three genuflexions, was permitted to kiss the feet of the holy father and
to lead by its bridle his mule. But, though they might have the will, the
popes had lost the power, and these great submissions were productive of
no good. Thirty years subsequently, Manuel, the son and successor of
Palæologus, took what might have seemed a more certain course. He
travelled to Paris and to London to lay his distress before the kings <span class="pag">[107]</span> of
<a id="France107"></a>France and England; but he received only pity, not aid. At the Council of
Constance Byzantine ambassadors appeared. It was, however, reserved for
the synods of Ferrara and of Florence to mature, as far as might be, the
negotiation. The second son of John Palæologus journeyed again into
Italy, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1438; and while Eugenius was being deposed in the chamber at
Basle, he was consummating the union of the East and West in the
Cathedral of Florence.
<span class="side"> The Greek Church yields to the Latin.</span>
 In the pulpit of that edifice, on the sixth of
July of that year, a Roman cardinal and a Greek archbishop embraced each
other before the people; Te Deum was chanted in Greek, mass was
celebrated in Latin, and the Creed was read with the "Filioque." The
successor of Constantine the Great had given up his religion, but he had
received no equivalent&mdash;no aid. The state of the Church, its disorders
and schisms, rendered any community of action in the West impossible.</p>


<p><span class="side">Mohammed II.</span>The last, the inevitable hour at length struck. Mohammed&nbsp;II. is said to
have been a learned man, able to express himself in five different
languages; skilful in mathematics, especially in their practical
application to engineering; an admirer of the fine arts; prodigal in his
liberality to Italian painters. In Asia Minor, as in Spain, there was
free thinking among the disciples of the Prophet. It was affirmed that
the sultan, in his moments of relaxation, was often heard to deride the
religion of his country as an imposture. His doubts in that particular
were, however, compensated for by his determination to carry out the
intention of so many of his Mohammedan predecessors&mdash;the seizure of
Constantinople.</p>


<p><span class="side">The siege of Constantinople.</span>At this time the venerable city had so greatly declined that it contained
only 100,000 inhabitants&mdash;out of them only 4970 able or willing to bear
arms. The besieging force was more than a quarter of a million of men. As
Mohammed pressed forward his works, the despairing emperor in vain looked
for the long-promised effectual Western aid. In its extremity, the
devoted metropolis was divided by religious feuds; and when a Latin
priest officiated in St. Sophia, there <span class="pag">[108]</span> were <a id="many108"></a>many who exclaimed that they
would rather see the turban of the sultan than the tiara of the pope. In
several particulars the siege of Constantinople marked out the end of old
ages and the beginning of new. Its walls were shaken by the battering
rams of the past, and overthrown by cannon, just then coming into general
use. Upon a plank road, shipping was passed through the open country, in
the darkness of a single night, a distance of ten miles. The works were
pushed forward toward the walls, on the top of which the sentinels at
length could hear the shouts of the Turks by their nocturnal fires. They
were sounds such as Constantinople might well listen to. She had taught
something different for many a long year. "God is God; there is none but
God." In the streets an image of the Virgin was carried in solemn
procession. Now or never she must come to the help of those who had done
so much for her, who had made her a queen in heaven and a goddess upon
earth. The cry of her worshippers was in vain.</p>


<p><span class="side">Fall of the city.</span>On May&nbsp;29th, 1453, the assault was delivered. Constantine Palæologus, the
last of the Roman emperors, putting off his purple, that no man might
recognize and insult his corpse when the catastrophe was over, fell, as
became a Roman emperor, in the breach. After his death resistance ceased,
and the victorious Turks poured into the town. To the Church of St.
Sophia there rushed a promiscuous crowd of women and children, priests,
monks, religious virgins, and&mdash;men. Superstitious to the last, in this
supreme moment they expected the fulfilment of a prophecy that, when the
Turks should have forced their way to the square before that church,
their progress would be arrested, for an angel with a sword in his hand
would descend from heaven and save the city of the Lord. The Turks burst
into the square, but the angel never came.</p>

<p>More than two thirds of the inhabitants of Constantinople were carried
prisoners into the Turkish camp&mdash;the men for servitude, the women for a
still more evil fate. The churches were sacked. From the dome of St.
Sophia its glories were torn down. The divine images, for the sake of
which Christendom had been sundered in <span class="pag">[109]</span> former <a id="days109"></a>days, unresistingly
submitted to the pious rage of the Mohammedans without working a single
miracle, and, stripped of their gems and gold, were brought to their
proper value in the vile uses of kitchens and stables. On that same day
the Muezzin ascended the loftiest turret of St. Sophia, and over the City
of the Trinity proclaimed the Oneness of God. The sultan performed his
prayers at the great altar, directing the edifice to be purified from its
idolatries and consecrated to the worship of God. Thence he repaired to
the palace, and, reflecting on the instability of human prosperity,
repeated, as he entered it, the Persian verse: "The spider has woven his
web in the imperial palace; the owl hath sung her watch song on the
towers of Afrasiab."</p>

<p>This solemn event&mdash;the fall of Constantinople&mdash;accomplished, there was no
need of any reconciliation of the Greek and Latin Churches. The sword of
Mohammed had settled their dispute. Constantinople had submitted to the
fate of Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Carthage.
<span class="side">Terror of Christendom at the fall of Constantinople.</span>
Christendom was struck
with consternation. The advance of the Turks in Europe was now very
rapid. Corinth and Athens fell, and the reduction of Greece was
completed. The confines of Italy were approached <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1461. The
Mohammedan flag confronted that peninsula along the Adriatic coast. In
twenty years more Italy was invaded. Otranto was taken; its bishop killed
at the door of his church. At this period, it was admitted that the
Turkish infantry, cavalry, and artillery were the best in the world.
Soliman the Magnificent took Belgrade <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1520.
<span class="side">Progress of the Turks.</span>
Nine years afterwards
the Turks besieged Vienna, but were repulsed. Soliman now prepared for
the subjugation of Italy, and was only diverted from it by an accident
which turned him upon the Venetians. It was not until the battle of
Lepanto that the Turkish advance was fairly checked. Even as it was, in
the complicated policy and intrigues of Europe its different sovereigns
could not trust one another; their common faith had ceased to be a common
bond: in all it had been weakened, in some destroyed. Æneas Sylvius,
speaking of Christendom, says, "It is a body without a head, a republic
<span class="pag">[110]</span> without <a id="laws110"></a>laws or magistrates. The pope or the emperor may shine as lofty
titles, an splendid images; but they are unable to command, and no one is
willing to obey." But, during this period of Turkish aggression, had not
the religious dissensions of Christendom been decently composed, there
was imminent danger that Europe would have been Mohammedanized. A bitter
experience of past ages, as well as of the present, had taught it that
the Roman Church was utterly powerless against such attacks. Safety was
to be looked for, not in any celestial aid, but in physical knowledge and
pecuniary resources, carried out in the organization of armies and
fleets. Had her authority been derived from the source she pretended, she
should have found an all-sufficient protection in prayer&mdash;indeed, not
even that should have been required. Men discovered at last that her
Litanies and her miracles were equally of no use, and that she must
trust, like any other human tyranny, to cannon and the sword.</p>


<p><span class="side">Effect of the Turkish invasion.</span>The Turkish aggression led to the staying of the democratic outbreak in
the bosom of the Church&mdash;the abstaining for a season from any farther
sapping of the papal autocracy. It was necessary that ecclesiastical
disputes, if they could not be ended, should, at all events, be kept for
a time in abeyance, and so indeed they were, until the pent-up
dissensions burst forth in "the Reformation." And thus, as we have
related, by Mohammedan knowledge in the West, papal Christianity was
well-nigh brought to ruin; thus, by a strange paradox, the Mohammedan
sword in the East gave it for a little longer a renewed lease of
political power, though never again of life.</p>


<p><span class="side">Nicolas&nbsp;V. a patron of art.</span>To Nicolas&nbsp;V., a learned and able pope, the catastrophe of Constantinople
was the death-blow. He had been the intimate friend of Cosmo de' Medici,
and from him had imbibed a taste for letters and art, but, like his
patron, he had no love for liberty. It was thus through commerce that the
papacy first learned to turn to art. The ensuing development of Europe
was really based on the commerce of upper Italy, and not upon the Church.
The statesmen of Florence were the inventors of the balance of power. A
lover of literature, Nicolas was <span class="pag">[111]</span> the <a id="founder111"></a>founder of the Vatican Library. He
clearly perceived the only course in which the Roman system could be
directed; that it was unfit for, and, indeed, incompatible with science,
but might be brought into unison with art. Its influence upon the reason
was gone, but the senses yet remained for it.
<span class="side">Gradual rise of the fine arts.</span>
 In continuing his policy,
the succeeding popes acted with wisdom. They gratified the genius of
their institutions, of their country, and their age. In the abundant
leisure of monasteries, the monks had found occupation in the
illumination of manuscripts. From the execution of miniatures they
gradually rose to an undertaking of greater works. In that manner
painting had originated in Italy in the twelfth century. Sculpture, at
first merged in architecture, had extricated herself from that bondage in
the fourteenth. The mendicant orders, acquiring wealth, became munificent
patrons. From caligraphic illustrations to the grand works of Michael
Angelo and Raffaelle is a prodigious advance, yet it took but a short
time to accomplish it.</p>


<p><span class="side">Review of the Age of Faith.</span>I have now completed the history of the European Age of Faith as far as
is necessary for the purposes of this book. It embraces a period of more
than a thousand years, counting from the reign of Constantine. It remains
to consider the intellectual peculiarity that marks the whole period&mdash;to
review briefly the agents that exerted an influence upon it and conducted
it to its close.</p>


<p><span class="side">Philosophical peculiarities of the Age of Faith.</span>Philosophically,
 the most remarkable peculiarity is the employment of a
false logic, a total misconception of the nature of evidence. It is
illustrated by miracle-proofs, trial by battle, ordeal tests, and a
universal belief in supernatural agency even for objectless purposes. On
the principles of this logic, if the authenticity of a thing or the proof
of a statement be required, it is supposed to be furnished by an
astounding illustration of something else. If the character of a princess
is assailed, she offers a champion; he proves victorious, and therefore
she was not frail.
<span class="side"> The character of its logic.</span>
If a national assembly, after a long discussion,
cannot decide "whether children should inherit the property of their
father during the lifetime of their <span class="pag">[112]</span> grandfather," <a id="an112"></a>an equal number of
equal combatants is chosen for each side; they fight; the champions of
the children prevail, and therefore the law is fixed in their favour. A
relic of some martyr is bought at a great price; no one seeks to
criticize the channel through which it has come, but every one asks, Can
it work a miracle? A vast institution demands the implicit obedience of
all men. It justifies its claim, not by the history of the past, but by
promises and threats of the future. A decrepit crone is suspected of
witchcraft. She is stripped naked and thrown into the nearest pond: if
she sinks, she is innocent; if she swims, she is in commerce with the
Devil. In all such cases the intrinsic peculiarity of the logic is
obvious enough; it shows a complete misconception of the nature of
evidence.
<span class="side">Its adoption of supernaturalism. </span>
 Yet this ratiocination governed Europe for a thousand years,
giving birth to those marvellous and supernatural explanations of
physical phenomena and events upon which we now look back with unfeigned
surprise, half disbelieving that it was possible for our ancestors to
have credited such things.
<span class="side">The Jews and Saracens destroy supernaturalism.</span>
Against this preposterous logic the
Mohammedans and Jews struck the first blows. We have already heard what
Algazzali the Arabian says respecting the enchanter who would prove that
three are more than ten by changing a stick into a serpent. The
circumstances under which the Jewish physicians acted we shall consider
presently.</p>

<p>It will not be useless to devote a little space to this belief in the
supernatural. It offers an opportunity of showing how false notions may
become universal, embody themselves in law and practical life, and
wonderful to be said, how they may, without anything being done to
destroy them, vanish from sight of themselves, like night-spectres before
the day. At present we only encounter them among the lowest peasant
grades, or among those who have been purposely kept in the most abject
state of ignorance. Less than a century ago the clergy of Spain wished to
have the Opera prohibited, because that ungodly entertainment had given
rise to a want of rain; but now, in a country so intellectually backward
as that&mdash;a witch was burnt there so lately as <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1781&mdash;such an <span class="pag">[113]</span> attempt
<a id="would113"></a>would call up sly wit, and make the rabble of Madrid suspect that the
archbishop was smarting under the rivalry of the prima donna, and that he
was furbishing up the rusty ecclesiastical enginery to sustain his cause.</p>


<p><span class="side">Respective influence of the clergy, the lawyers, and
physicians.</span>In the day of their power the ecclesiastical profession were the
supporters of this delusion. They found it suitable to their interests,
and, by dint of at first persuading others to believe, they at last, by
habit, came to believe in it themselves. The Mohammedans and Jews were
the first to assail it philosophically and by sarcasm, but its final ruin
was brought about by the action of the two other professions, the legal
and the medical. The lawyers, whose advent to power is seen in the
history of Philip the Fair, and whose rise from that time was very rapid,
were obliged to introduce the true methods of evidence; the physicians,
from their pursuits, were perpetually led to the material explanation of
natural phenomena in contradistinction to the mystical. It is to the
honour of both these professions that they never sought for a
perpetuation of power by schemes of vast organization, never attempted to
delude mankind by stupendous impostures, never compelled them to desist
from the expression of their thoughts, and even from thinking, by
alliances with civil power. Far from being the determined antagonists of
human knowledge, they uniformly fostered it, and, in its trials, defended
it. The lawyers were hated because they replaced supernatural logic by
philosophical logic; the physicians, because they broke down the
profitable but mendacious system of miracle-cures.</p>


<p><span class="side">Position of the Church.</span>Yet the Church is not without excuse. In all her varied history it was
impossible to disentangle her from the principles which at the beginning
had entered into her political organization. For good or evil, right or
wrong, her necessity required that she should put herself forth as the
possessor of all knowledge within the reach of human intellect&mdash;the
infallible arbitress of every question that should arise among men.
Doubtless it was a splendid imposture, capable for a time of yielding
great results, but sooner or later certain to be unmasked. Early
discovering the antagonism of science, which <span class="pag">[114]</span> could <a id="not114"></a>not fail, in due
season, to subject her pretensions to investigation, she lent herself to
a systematic delusion of the illiterate, and thereby tried to put off
that fatal day when creeds engendered in the darkness would have to be
examined in the light, enforcing her attempt with an unsparing, often
with a bloody hand.
<span class="side">She could not extricate herself from her false position.</span>
 It was for this reason that, when the inevitable time
of trial came, no intellectual defence could be made in her behalf, and
hence there only remained a recourse to physical and political
compulsion. But such a compulsion, under such circumstances, is not only
a testimony to the intrinsic weakness of that for which it is invoked, it
is also a token that they who resort to it have lost all faith in any
inherent power of the system they are supporting, and that, in truth, it
is fast coming to an end.</p>


<p><span class="side">Successive order in supernatural ideas.</span>The reader will remark, from the incidents connected with supernatural
delusions now to be related, that they follow a law of continuous
variation, the particular embodiment they assumed changing with the
condition of the human mind at each epoch under examination. For ages
they are implicitly believed in by all classes; then, to a few, but the
number perpetually increasing, they become an idle story of bare-faced
imposture. At last humanity wakens from its delusion&mdash;its dream. The
final rejection of the whole, in spite of the wonderful amount of
testimony which for ages had accumulated, occurs spontaneously the moment
that pyschical development has reached a certain point. There can be no
more striking illustration of the definite advancement of the human mind.
The boy who is terror-stricken in a dark room insensibly dismisses his
idle fears as he grows up to be a man.</p>


<p><span class="side">Oriental magicians&mdash;Simon Magus.</span>Clemens Romanus and Anastasius Sinaita, speaking of Simon Magus, say that
he could make himself invisible; that he formed a man out of air; that he
could pass bodily through mountains without being obstructed thereby;
that he could fly and sit unharmed in flames; that he constructed
animated statues and self-moving furniture, and not only changed his
countenance into the similitude of many other men, but that his whole
body could be transformed into the shape of a goat, a <span class="pag">[115]</span> sheep, a <a id="snake115"></a>snake;
that, as he walked in the street, he cast many shadows in different
directions; that he could make trees suddenly spring up in desert places;
and, on one occasion, compelled an enchanted sickle to go into a field
and reap twice as much in one day as if it had been used by a man.
<span class="side"> Greek thaumaturgists.</span>
 Of Apollonius of Tyana we are told that, after an unbroken silence of five
years, he comprehended the languages of all animals and all men; that,
under circumstances very picturesquely related, he detected the genius of
a plague at Ephesus, and dragged him, self-convicted, before the people;
that, at the wedding-dinner of Menippus, he caused all the dishes and
viands to vanish, thereby compelling the bride to acknowledge that she
was a vampire, intending to eat the flesh and lap the blood of her
husband in the night; that he exhibited the prodigy of being in many
places at the same time; raised a young woman from the dead; and,
finally, weary of the world, ascended bodily into heaven.</p>


<p><span class="side">Introduction of an Arabian element.</span>As Arabian influence spread, ideas of Oriental aspect appear. There are
peris who live on perfumes, and divs who are poisoned by them; enchanted
palaces; moving statues; veiled prophets, like Mokanna; brazen flying
horses; charmed arrows; dervises who can project their soul into the body
of a dead animal, giving it temporary life; enchanted rings, to make the
wearer invisible, or give him two different bodies at the same time;
ghouls who live in cemeteries, and at night eat the flesh of dead men. As
the European counterpart of these Perso-Arabic ideas, there are fairies,
and their dancing by moonlight, their tampering with children, and
imposing changelings on horror-stricken mothers.
<span class="side"> Introduction of European sorcery and witchcraft. </span>
 Every one believes that
rain and wind may be purchased of wizards, and that fair weather may be
obtained and storms abated by prayer. Whoever attains to wealth or
eminence does so by a compact with Satan, signed with blood. The head of
the Church, Sylvester&nbsp;II., makes a brazen head, which speaks to him
prophetically. He finds underground treasures in a subterranean magic
palace beneath a mountain. The protestator of the Greek emperor is
accused of a conspiracy against his master's life by making invisible
men. Robert <span class="pag">[116]</span> Grostête, <a id="the116"></a>the Bishop of Lincoln, makes another speaking
head. Nay, more, Albertus Magnus constructs a complete brazen man, so
cunningly contrived as to serve him for a domestic. This was at the time
that Thomas Aquinas was living with him. The household trouble arising
from the excessive garrulity of this simulacrum grew so intolerable&mdash;for
it was incessantly making mischief among the other inmates&mdash;that Thomas,
unable to bear it any longer, took a hammer and broke the troublesome
android to pieces.
<span class="side">These ideas infect all classes.</span>
 This reverend father, known among his contemporaries
as the "seraphic doctor," was not without experience in the mysterious
craft. Annoyed by the frequent passing of horses near his dwelling, he
constructed a magical horse of brass, and buried it in the road. From
that moment no animal could be made to pass his door. Among brazen heads
of great celebrity is that of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungy. This oracle
announced, "Time is; time was; time is passed;" perhaps it was some kind
of clock. The alchemist Peter d'Apono had seven spirits in glass bottles.
He had entrapped them by baiting with distilled dew, and imprisoned them
safely by dexterously putting in the corks. He is the same who possessed
a secret which it is greatly to be regretted that he did not divulge for
the benefit of chemists who have come after him, that, whatever money he
paid, within the space of one hour's time came back of itself again into
his pocket. That was better than even the philosopher's stone.</p>


<p><span class="side">Modifications of supernaturalism.</span>These supernatural notions were at different times modified by two
intrusive elements, the first being the Perso-Arabic just alluded to, the
second derived from the north of Europe. This element was witchcraft;
for, though long before, among Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans, decrepit
women were known as witches&mdash;as the Thessalian crone who raised a corpse
from the dead for Sextus by lashing it with a snake&mdash;it was not until a
later period that this element was fairly developed.
<span class="side"> The persecutions for witchcraft. </span>
 A bull of Pope
Innocent&nbsp;VIII., published <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1484, says, "It has come to our ears that
numbers of both sexes do not avoid to have intercourse with the infernal
fiends, and that by their sorceries they <span class="pag">[117]</span> afflict <a id="both117"></a>both man and beast.
They blight the marriage-bed; destroy the births of women and the
increase of cattle; they blast the corn on the ground, the grapes in the
vineyard, the fruits of the trees, and the grass and herbs of the field."
At this time, therefore, the head of the Church had not relinquished a
belief in these delusions. The consequences of the punishment he ordained
were very dreadful. In the valleys of the Alps many hundred aged women
were committed to the flames under an accusation of denying Christ,
dishonouring the crucifix, and solemnizing a devil's sabbath in company
with the fiend. Such persecutions, begun by papal authority, continued
among illiterate zealots till late times, and, as is well known, were
practised even in America. Very masculine minds fell into these
delusions. Thus Luther, in his work on the abuses attendant on private
masses, says that he had conferences with the Devil on that subject,
passing many bitter nights and much restless and wearisome repose; that
once, in particular, Satan came to him in the dead of the night, when he
was just awakened out of sleep.
<span class="side">Experiences of Luther.</span>
 "The Devil," says Luther, "knows well enough how to construct his arguments, and to urge them with the skill of
a master. He delivers himself with a grave and yet with a shrill voice.
Nor does he use circumlocutions and beat about the bush, but excels in
forcible statements and quick rejoinders. I no longer wonder that the
persons whom he assails in this way are occasionally found dead in their
beds. He is able to compress and throttle, and more than once he has so
assaulted me and driven my soul into a corner that I have felt as if the
next moment it must leave my body. I am of opinion that Gesner and
&OElig;colampadius came in that manner to their deaths. The Devil's manner
of opening a debate is pleasant enough, but he soon urges things so
peremptorily that the respondent in a short time knows not how to acquit
himself."</p>


<p><span class="side">English wizards&mdash;Scotch witches.</span>Social eminence is no preservative from social delusion. When it was
affirmed that Agnes Sampson, with two hundred other Scotch witches, had
sailed in sieves from Leith to North Berwick church to hold a banquet
with the Devil, James&nbsp;I. had the torture applied to the wretched woman,
and took <span class="pag">[118]</span> pleasure <a id="in118"></a>in putting appropriate questions to her after the
racking had been duly prolonged. It then came out that the two hundred
crones had baptized and drowned a black cat, thereby raising a dreadful
storm in which the ship that carried the king narrowly escaped being
wrecked. Upon this Agnes was condemned to the flames. She died protesting
her innocence, and piteously calling on Jesus to have mercy on her, for
Christian men would not. On the accession of James to the English throne
he procured an act of Parliament against any one convicted of witchcraft,
sorcery, or enchantment, or having commerce with the Devil. Under this
monstrous statute many persons suffered. At this time England was
intellectually in a very backward state.
<span class="side"> French and English legal proceedings.</span>
The statute remained until 1736 unrepealed. The French
preceded the English in putting a stop to these atrocities; for
Louis&nbsp;XIV., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1672, by
an order in council, forbade the tribunals from inflicting penalty
in accusations of sorcery.</p>

<p>Can the reader of the preceding paragraphs here pause without demanding
of himself the value of human testimony? All these delusions, which
occupied the minds of our forefathers, and from which not even the
powerful and learned were free, have totally passed away.
<span class="side">The total disappearance of these delusions.</span>
 The moonlight
has now no fairies; the solitude no genius; the darkness no ghost, no
goblin. There is no necromancer who can raise the dead from their
graves&mdash;no one who has sold his soul to the Devil and signed the contract
with his blood&mdash;no angry apparition to rebuke the crone who has
disquieted him. Divination, agromancy, pyromancy, hydromancy,
cheiromancy, augury, interpreting of dreams, oracles, sorcery, astrology,
have all gone. It is 350 years since the last sepulchral lamp was found,
and that was near Rome. There are no gorgons, hydras, chimæras; no
familiars; no incubus or succubus. The housewives of Holland no longer
bring forth sooterkins by sitting over lighted chauffers. No longer do
captains buy of Lapland witches favourable winds; no longer do our
churches resound with prayers against the baleful influences of comets,
though there still linger in some of our noble old rituals forms <span class="pag">[119]</span> of
<a id="supplication119"></a>supplication for dry weather and rain, useless but not unpleasing
reminiscences of the past. The apothecary no longer says prayers over the
mortar in which he is pounding to impart a divine afflatus to his drugs.
Who is there now that pays fees to a relic or goes to a saint-shrine to
be cured? These delusions have vanished with the night to which they
appertained, yet they were the delusions of fifteen hundred years. In
their support might be produced a greater mass of human testimony than
probably could be brought to bear on any other matter of belief in the
entire history of man; and yet, in the nineteenth century, we have come
to the conclusion that the whole, from the beginning to the end, was a
deception.
<span class="side">Value of human testimony.</span>
 Let him, therefore, who is disposed to balance the testimony
of past ages against the dictates of his own reason ponder on this
strange history; let him who relies on the authority of human evidence in
the guidance of his opinions now settle with himself what that evidence
is worth.</p>


<p><span class="side">Supernaturalism appertains to a period of life.</span>But, though in one sense this history is humiliating to the philosopher,
in another it is full of interest. Supernaturalism, both in the
individual and in society, appertains to a definite period of life. It is
shaken off as men and nations approach maturity. The child and the youth
people solitude and darkness with unrealities. The adult does not so much
convince himself of their fictitious nature by reasoning on the results
of his experience&mdash;he grows out of them, as we see that society has done.
Nevertheless, his emancipation is quickened if he is among those who
instruct his curiosity and deride his fears. It was in this manner that
the decline of supernaturalism in the West was very much accelerated by
Jewish physicians. They, more than the lawyers, were concerned in the
ending of these delusions.
<span class="side"> Influence of the Jews on supernaturalism.</span>
 These apparitions, as is the nature of their
kind, vanished as soon as the crowing of the Æsculapian cock announced
that the intellectual day of Europe was on the point of breaking. The
Jews held in their hands much of the trade of the world; they were in
perpetual movement and commercial intercommunication. Locomotion&mdash;for
such is always <span class="pag">[120]</span> its <a id="result120"></a>result&mdash;tended to make them intellectual. The
persecutions under which they had long suffered bound their distant
communities together. The Spanish Jews knew very well what was going on
among their co-religionists beyond the Euphrates. As Cabanis says, "They
were our factors and bankers before we knew how to read; they were also
our first physicians." To this it may be added that they were, for
centuries, the only men in Europe who saw the course of human affairs
from the most general point of view.</p>

<p>The Hellenizing Jewish physicians inoculated the Arabs with learning on
their first meeting with them in Alexandria, obtaining a private and
personal influence with many of khalifs, and from that central point of
power giving an intellectual character to the entire Saracenic movement.
We have already seen that in this they were greatly favoured by the
approximation of their unitarianism to that of the Mohammedans. The
intellectual activity of the Asiatic and African Jews soon communicated
an impulse to those of Europe. The Hebrew doctor was viewed by the vulgar
with wonder, fear, and hatred; no crime could be imputed to him too
incredible. Thus Zedekias, the physician to Charles the Bald, was
asserted to have devoured at one meal, in the presence of the court, a
waggon-load of hay, together with its horses and driver.
<span class="side">Writings of Jewish physicians.</span>
 The titles of
some of the works that appeared among them deserve mention, as displaying
a strong contrast with the mystical designations in vogue. Thus Isaac Ben
Soleiman, an Egyptian, wrote "On Fevers," "On Medicine," "On Food and
Remedies," "On the Pulse," "On Philosophy," "On Melancholy," "An
Introduction to Logic." The simplicity of these titles displays an
intellectual clearness and a precision of thought which have ever been
shown by the Israelites. They are in themselves sufficient to convince us
of the strong common sense which these men were silently infusing into
the literature of Western Europe in ages of concealment and
mystification. Roger Bacon, at a much later time, gave to one of his
works the title of "The Green Lion;" to another, "The Treatise of Three
Words."</p>

<p>Since it was by the power and patronage of the <span class="pag">[121]</span> Saracens <a id="that121"></a>that the Jewish
physicians were acting, it is not surprising that the language used in
many of their compositions was Arabic. Translations were, however,
commonly made into Hebrew, and, at a subsequent period, into Latin.
Through the ninth century the Asiatic colleges maintained their previous
celebrity in certain branches of knowledge. Thus the Jew Shabtai Donolo
was obliged to go to Bagdad to complete his studies in astronomy.
<span class="side">Foundation of colleges.</span>
As Arabian influence extended itself into Sicily and Italy, Jewish
intelligence accompanied it, and schools were founded at Tarentum,
Salerno, Bari, and other places. Here the Arab and Jew Orientalists first
amalgamated with a truly European element&mdash;the Greek&mdash;as is shown by the
circumstance that in the college at Salerno instruction was given through
the medium of all three languages. At one time, Pontus taught in Greek,
Abdallah in Arabic, and Elisha in Hebrew. A similar influence of the Arab
and Jew combined founded the University of Montpellier.</p>


<p><span class="side">Medical studies among the Jews.</span>
After the foundation of medical colleges, the progress of medicine among
the Jews was very rapid. Judged by our standard, in some respects it was
peculiar. Thus, they looked upon the practice of surgery as altogether
mechanical, and therefore ignoble. A long list of eminent names might be
extracted from the tenth and eleventh centuries. In it we should find
Haroun of Cordova, Jehuda of Fez, Amram of Toledo. Already it was
apparent that the Saracenic movement would aid in developing the
intelligence of barbarian Western Europe through Hebrew physicians, in
spite of opposition encountered from theological ideas imported from
Constantinople and Rome. Mohammedanism had all along been the patron of
physical science; paganizing Christianity not only repudiated it, but
exhibited towards it sentiments of contemptuous disdain and hatred.
<span class="side"> Imposture-medicine.</span>
Hence physicians were viewed by the Church with dislike, and regarded as
atheists by the people, who held firmly to the lessons they had been
taught that cures must be wrought by relics of martyrs and bones of
saints, by prayers and intercessions, and that each region of the body
was under some spiritual charge&mdash;the <span class="pag">[122]</span> first <a id="joint122"></a>joint of the right thumb
being in the care of God the Father, the second under that of the blessed
Virgin, and so on of other parts. For each disease there was a saint. A
man with sore eyes must invoke St. Clara, but if it were an inflammation
elsewhere he must turn to St. Anthony. An ague would demand the
assistance of St. Pernel. For the propitiating of these celestial beings
it was necessary that fees should be paid, and thus the practice of
imposture-medicine became a great source of profit.</p>

<p>In all this there was no other intention than that of extracting money
from the illiterate. With men of education and position it was different.
Bishops, princes, kings, and popes had each in private his Hebrew doctor,
though all understood that he was a contraband luxury, in many countries
pointedly and absolutely prohibited by the law.
<span class="side">The rabbis cultivate medicine and other sciences.</span>
 In the eleventh century
nearly all the physicians in Europe were Jews. This was due to two
different causes: the Church would tolerate no interference with her
spiritual methods of treating disease, which formed one of her most
productive sources of gain; and the study of medicine had been formally
introduced into the rabbinical schools. The monk was prohibited a pursuit
which gave to the rabbi an honourable emolument. From the older
institutions offshoots in quick succession appeared, particularly in
France. Thus the school at Narbonne was under the presidency of Doctor
Rabbi Abou. There was also a flourishing school at Arles. In these
institutions instruction was given through the medium of Hebrew and
Arabic, the Greek element present at Salerno being here wanting. In the
French schools, to the former languages Latin and Provençal were, in the
course of time, added. The versatility of acquirement among the
physicians, who were taking the lead in this intellectual movement, is
illustrated both by the Spanish and French Jews. Some, like Djanah, a
native of Cordova, acquired reputation in grammar, criticism, astronomy;
others in poetry or theology.</p>

<p>If thus the social condition of the rabbis, who drew no income from their
religious duties, induced them to combine the practice of medicine with
their pursuits, great facilities had arisen for mental culture through
<span class="pag">[123]</span> the <a id="establishment123"></a>establishment of so many schools. Henceforth the Jewish physician is
recognised as combining with his professional skill a profound knowledge
of theology, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, music, law. In a
singular manner he stands aloof in the barbarian societies among whom he
lives, looking down like a philosopher upon their idolatries, permitting,
or even excusing them, like a statesman.
<span class="side">Writings of the Spanish-Jewish physicians.</span>
 Of those who thus adorned the
eleventh century was Rabbi Solomon Ben Isaac, better known under the
abbreviation Raschi&mdash;called by his countrymen the Prince of Commentators.
He was equally at home in writing commentaries on the Talmud, or in
giving instructions for great surgical operations, as the Cæsarean
section. He was the greatest French physician of his age. Spain during
the same century, produced a worthy competitor to him, Ebn Zohr,
physician to the court of Seville. His writings were in Hebrew, Arabic,
Syriac, and both in prose and verse. He composed a treatise on the cure
of diseases, and two on fevers. In singular contrast with the
superstitious notions of the times, he possessed a correct view of the
morbific nature of marsh miasm. He was followed by Ben Ezra, a Jew of
Toledo, who was at once a physician, philosopher, mathematician,
astronomer, critic, poet. He travelled all over Europe and Asia, being
held in captivity for some time in India. Among his medical writings was
a work on theoretical and practical medicine, entitled "Book of Proofs."
Through the wars arising in Spain between the Mohammedans and Christians,
many learned Jews were driven into France, imparting to that country, by
their presence, a new intellectual impulse. Of such were Aben Tybbon, who
gave to his own profession a pharmaceutical tendency by insisting on the
study of botany and art of preparing drugs. Ben Kimchi, a Narbonnese
physician and grammarian, wrote commentaries on the Bible, sacred and
moral poems, a Hebrew grammar. Notwithstanding the opposition of the
ecclesiastics, William, the Lord of Montpellier, passed an edict
authorizing all persons, without exception, to profess medicine in the
university of his city. This was specially meant for the relief of the
Jews, <span class="pag">[124]</span> though <a id="expressed124"></a>expressed in a general way.
<span class="side"> Maimonides.</span>
 Spain, though she had thus lost
many of her learned men, still continued to produce others of which she
had reason to be proud. Moussa Ben Maimon, known all over Europe as
Maimonides, was recognized by his countrymen as "the Doctor, the Great
Sage, the Glory of the West, the Light of the East, second only to
Moses." He is often designated by the four initials R. M. B. M., that is
Rabbi Moses Ben Maimon, or briefly Rambam. His biography presents some
points of interest. He was born at Cordova <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1135, and, while yet
young, wrote commentaries on the Talmuds both of Babylon and Jerusalem,
and also a work on the Calendar; but, embracing Mohammedanism, he
emigrated to Egypt, and there became physician to the celebrated Sultan
Saladin. Among his works are medical aphorisms, derived from former
Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic sources; an abridgment of Galen; and of
his original treatises, which were very numerous, may be mentioned those
"On Hemorrhoids," "On Poisons and Antidotes," "On Asthma," "On the
Preservation of Health,"&mdash;the latter being written for the benefit of the
son of Saladin&mdash;"On the Bites of Venomous Animals"&mdash;written by order of
the sultan&mdash;"On Natural History." His "Moreh Nevochim," or "Teacher of
the Perplexed," was an attempt to reconcile the doctrines of the Old
Testament with reason. In addition to these, he had a book on Idolatry,
and one on Christ. Besides Maimonides, the sultan had another physician,
Ebn Djani, the author of a work on the medical topography of the city of
Alexandria. From the biographies of these learned men of the twelfth
century it would seem that their religious creed hung lightly upon them.
Not unfrequently they became converted to Mohammedanism.</p>


<p><span class="side">Later Jewish physicians.</span>It might be tedious if I should record the names and writings of the
learned European Jews of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a period
more prolific of these great men than even the preceding ages. But I
cannot pass these later centuries without mentioning the Alphonsine
Tables, calculated for Alphonso, the King of Castile, by Mascha, his
Hebrew physician. The irreligious tendency of the times is illustrated by
the <span class="pag">[125]</span> well-known <a id="sarcasm125"></a>sarcasm uttered by that Spanish monarch respecting the
imperfect construction of the heavens, according to the Ptolemaic
hypothesis. For long, however, the Jews had been dabbling in
free-thinking speculations. Thus Aben Tybbon, above-mentioned,
anticipating that branch of science which has drawn upon itself, in later
years, so much opprobrium, wrote a work containing a discussion of the
causes which prevent the waters of the sea from encroaching on the land.
Abba Mari, a Marseillese Jew, translated the Almagest of Ptolemy and the
Commentary of Averroes upon it. The school of Salerno was still sending
forth its doctors. In Rome, Jewish physicians were very numerous, the
popes themselves employing them. Boniface&nbsp;VIII. had for his medical
adviser Rabbi Isaac. At this period Spain and France were full of learned
Jews; and perhaps partly by their exerting upon the higher classes with
whom they came in contact too much influence, for the physician of a
Christian prince was very often the rival of his confessor, and partly
because the practice of medicine, as they pursued it, interfered with the
gains of the Church, the clergy took alarm, and caused to be re-enacted
or enforced the ancient laws. The Council of Beziers, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1246, and the
Council of Alby, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1254, prohibited all Christians from resorting to
the services of an Israelitish physician. It would appear that these
enactments had either fallen into desuetude or had failed to be enforced.
The faculty of Paris, awakening at last to the danger of the case,
caused, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1301, a decree to be published prohibiting either man or
woman of the religion of Moses from practising medicine upon any person
of the Catholic religion. A similar course was also taken in Spain. At
this time the Jews were confessedly at the head of French medicine. It
was the appointment of one of their persuasion, Profatius, as regent of
the faculty of Montpellier <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1300, which drew upon them the wrath of
the faculty of Paris. This learned man was a skilful astronomer; he
composed tables of the moon; of the longitudes of many Asiatic and
African towns; he determined the obliquity of the ecliptic, his result
being honourably alluded to by Copernicus.
<span class="side"> The University of Paris causes the expulsion of the Jews from France.</span>
The animosity of the French
ecclesiastics against the Jewish physicians <span class="pag">[126]</span> at <a id="last126"></a>last led to the
banishment of all the Jews from France, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1306. "It was," say the
historians of this event, "a most revolting spectacle to see so many
learned men, who had adorned and benefited France, proscribed, wanderers
without a country or an asylum. Some of them expired of grief upon the
road. Abba Mari gives in his work heart-rending details of the expulsion
of the Jews from Montpellier, at the head of whom were the professors and
doctors of the faculty."</p>


<p><span class="side">Result that they had accomplished.</span>But, though thus driven into exile, these strangers had accomplished
their destiny. They had silently deposited in France their ideas. They
had sapped the credulity of the higher classes in Europe, and taught them
to turn away from the supernatural. A clear recognition of their agency
in this matter fastened upon them the watchful eye of Inquisition, and
made them the victims of its tyranny.</p>

<p>And so it might well be. Out of the Spanish peninsula there had come
across the Pyrenees an intellectual influence, which reached the populace
under the form of a fresh and pleasing literature, and the better classes
by novel but unorthodox ideas. To a very great extent the Jews had been
its carriers. The result was the overthrow of supernaturalism.
<span class="side">Destruction of fairies by tobacco.</span>
We shall
hardly accept the affirmation of good Catholics that fairies disappeared
on account of the Reformation, unable to bear the morose sectarianism
with which it was accompanied, or the still more material explanation of
the rustics that it was through the introduction of tobacco. However that
may be, no longer is Robin Goodfellow the compeller of household
duties&mdash;no longer do bad elves sit by the dying embers of the
hearth-stone at night, in the shape of shrivelled frogs, after the family
have gone to bed. For a long time there have been no miracles in Europe.
Even Rome, the workshop of those artifices, has ceased to be the seat of
that trade.</p>

<p>From human institutions of any kind, a great principle, firmly inwrought
and inwoven at the beginning, can never be removed. It will show itself
whenever occasion permits. The animosity between the Byzantine <span class="pag">[127]</span>
ecclesiastical <a id="system127"></a>system and all true wisdom was inextinguishable, though
it was utterly foreign to Christianity.
<span class="side">Causes of the ecclesiastical opposition. </span>
 It was fastened by imperial
violence on the nations, and made its appearance, with unabated force, at
intervals of ages. The same evil instinct which tore Hypatia piecemeal in
the church at Alexandria brought Galileo into the custody of the
familiars of the holy office at Rome. The necessary consequence of this
upholding ignorance by force was the emergence of ideas successively more
and more depraved.
<span class="side">Degraded state of Italy.</span>
 Whoever will ingenuously compare the religious state
of Italy in the fourteenth century with its state in the fourth&mdash;that is,
the recent Italian with the old Roman&mdash;will find that among the
illiterate classes nothing whatever had been accomplished. There were no
elevated thoughts of holy things. From practical devotion God had
altogether disappeared; the Saviour had been supplanted by the blessed
Virgin; and she herself&mdash;such was the increasing degradation&mdash;had been
abandoned for the ignoble worship of apotheosized men, who, under the
designation of saints, had engrossed all the votaries. There had been a
rapid descent to the last degree of more than African abasement in
bleeding statues and winking pictures.</p>


<p><span class="side">Rise of a new social system.</span>In Europe there had been incorporated old forms of worship and old
festivals with Christian ones; the local gods and goddesses had been
replaced by saints; for deification canonization had been substituted.
There had been produced a civilization, the character of which was its
extraordinary intolerance. A man could not be suspected of doubting the
popular belief without risk to his goods, his body, or his life. As a
necessary consequence, there could be no great lawgivers, no
philosophers, no poets. Society was pervaded by a systematic hypocrisy.
This tyranny over others sometimes led to strange results. It caused the
Jews to discover the art of making wealth invisible by bills of exchange
and other such like means, so that money might be imperceptibly but
instantaneously moved.</p>


<p><span class="side">Influence of that new system, </span>Thus, after the dying out of Greek science, there followed, among the new
populations, an intellectual immobility, which soon became the centre of
a vast number <span class="pag">[128]</span> of <a id="growing128"></a>growing interests quickly and firmly crystallizing
round it. For them it was essential that there should be no change&mdash;no
advance. In the midst of jarrings and conflicts between those interests,
that condition was steadfastly maintained, as if through instinct, by
them all. It mattered not how antiquated were the forms insisted on, nor
how far they outraged common sense. New life was given to decaying
illusions, and, in return, strength was gathered from them.
<span class="side">and degradation by African ideas.</span>
Isis, with
the moon beneath her feet, was planted, under a new name, on the
Bosphorus and the Tiber. African theology, African ecclesiastical
machinery, and African monasticism were made objects of reverence to
unsuspecting Europe. Juvenal says that the Roman painters of his day
lived on the goddess Isis. The Italian painters of a later day lived on
her modernized form.</p>


<p><span class="side">No literature in the Age of Faith. </span>In such a condition of things the literary state could be no other than
barren. Political combinations had not only prescribed an intellectual
terminus, but had even laid down a rail upon which mental excursions were
to be made, and from which there was no departing; or, if a turn-out was
permitted, it was managed by a tonsured man. For centuries together, if
we exclude theological writings, there was absolutely no literature worth
the name. Life seems to have been spent in the pursuit of mere physical
enjoyment, and that enjoyment of a very low kind. When in the South of
France and Sicily literature began to dawn, it is not to be overlooked
how much of it was of an amatory kind; and love is the strongest of the
passions. The first aspect of Western literature was animal, not
intellectual.
<span class="side">Its critical innocence.</span>
 A taste for learning excited, there reappeared in the
schools the old treatises written a thousand years before&mdash;the Elements
of Euclid, the Geography of Ptolemy. Long after the Reformation there was
an intellectual imbecility which might well excite our mirth, if it were
not the index of a stage through which the human mind must pass. Often
enough we see it interestingly in the interweaving of the new with the
old ideas. If we take up a work on metallurgy, it commences with <span class="pag">[129]</span> Tubal
<a id="Cain129"></a>Cain; if on music, with Jubal. The history of each country is traced back
to the sons of Noah, or at least to the fugitives from the siege of Troy.
An admiration for classical authors may perhaps be excused. It exhibited
itself amusingly in the eccentricity of interlarding compositions of
every kind with Greek and Latin quotations. This was an age of literary
innocence, when no legend was too stupendous for credulity; when there
was no one who had ever suspected that Tully, as they delighted to call
him, was not a great philosopher, and Virgil not a great poet.</p>


<p><span class="side">Disuse of patristic works.</span>Of those ponderous, those massive folios on ecclesiastical affairs, at
once the product and representatives of the time, but little needs here
to be said. They boasted themselves as the supreme effort of human
intellect; they laid claim to an enduring authority; to many they had a
weight little less than the oracles of God. But if their intrinsic value
is to be measured by their pretensions, and their pretensions judged of
by their present use, what is it that must be said? Long ago their term
was reached, long ago they became obsolete. They have no reader. Such
must be the issue of any literature springing from an immovable, an
unexpanding basis, the offspring of thought that has been held in
subjugation by political formulas, or of intellectual energies that have
been cramped.</p>


<p><span class="side">Spread of science in France.</span>The Roman ecclesiastical system, like the Byzantine, had been irrevocably
committed in an opposition to intellectual development. It professed to
cultivate the morals, but it crushed the mind. Yet, in the course of
events, this state of things was to come to an end through the working of
other principles equally enduring and more powerful. They constitute what
we may speak of under the title of the Arabian element. On preceding
pages it has been shown that, when the Saracens conquered Egypt, they
came under the influence of the Nestorians and Hellenizing Jews,
acquiring from them a love of philosophy, which soon manifested itself in
full energy from the banks of the Euphrates to those of Guadalquivir. The
hammer of Charles Martel might strike down the ranks of the Saracens on
the field <span class="pag">[130]</span> of <a id="Tours130"></a>Tours, but there was something intangible, something
indestructible accompanying them, which the Frank chivalry could not
confront. To the Church there was an evil omen. It has been well remarked
that in the Provençal poetry there are noble bursts of crusading
religious sentiment, but they are incorporated with a sovereign contempt
for the clergy.</p>

<p>The biography of any of the physicians or alchemists of the thirteenth
century would serve the purpose of illustrating the watchfulness of the
Church, the unsound condition of the universities, the indirect patronage
extended to heretics by eminent men, and the manner in which the rival
powers, ecclesiasticism and philosophy, were preparing for their final
conflict.
<span class="side">Illustration from the biography of Arnold.</span>
As an example of the kind, I may present briefly that of Arnold
de Villa Nova, born about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1250. He enjoyed a great reputation for
his knowledge of medicine and alchemy. For some years he was physician to
the King of Aragon. Under an accusation of defective orthodoxy he lost
his position at court, his punishment being rendered more effective by
excommunication. Hoping to find in Paris more liberality than he had met
with in Spain, he fled to that city, but was pursued by an adverse
ecclesiastical influence with a charge of having sold his soul to the
Devil, and of having changed a plate of copper into gold. In Montpellier,
to which he was obliged to retire, he found a more congenial intellectual
atmosphere, and was for long one of the regents of the faculty of
medicine. In succession, he subsequently resided in Florence, Naples,
Palermo, patronized and honoured by the Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II.&mdash;at that
time engaged in the attempt to unite Italy into one kingdom and give it a
single language&mdash;on account of his extraordinary reputation as a
physician. Even the pope, Clement&nbsp;V., notwithstanding the unfortunate
attitude in which Arnold stood toward the Church, besought a visit from
him in hopes of relief from the stone. On his voyage for the purpose of
performing the necessary operation, Arnold suffered shipwreck and was
drowned. His body was interred at Genoa. The pope issued an encyclic
letter, entreating those who owed him obedience to reveal where Arnold's
Treatise  <span class="pag">[131]</span> on <a id="the131"></a>the Practice of Medicine might be found, it having been lost
or concealed. It appears that the chief offences committed by Arnold
against the Church were that he had predicted that the world would come
to an end <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1335; that he had said the bulls of the pope were only
the work of a man, and that the practice of charity is better than
prayer, or even than the mass. If he was the author of the celebrated
book "De Tribus Impostoribus," as was suspected by some, it is not
remarkable that he was so closely watched and disciplined. Like many of
his contemporaries, he mingled a great deal of mysticism with his work,
recommending, during his alchemical operations, the recitation of psalms,
to give force to the materials employed. Among other such things, he
describes a seal, decorated with scriptural phrases, of excellent use in
preserving one from sudden death. It appears, however, to have failed of
its effect on the night when Arnold's ship was drifting on an Italian
lee-shore, and he had most need of it.</p>


<p><span class="side">Two impulses&mdash;intellectual and moral&mdash;in operation.</span>The two antagonistic principles&mdash;ecclesiastical and intellectual&mdash;were
thus brought in presence of each other. On other occasions they had
already been in partial collision, as at the iconoclastic dispute which
originated in the accusations of the Mohammedans, and ended in the
tearing of Christendom asunder.</p>


<p><span class="side">Struggle of ecclesiasticism against the intellectual principle.</span>Again there was a collision, a few centuries later, when the Spanish
Moors and Jews began to influence the higher European classes. Among the
bishops, sovereigns, and even popes thus affected, there were many men of
elevated views, who saw distinctly the position of Europe, and understood
thoroughly the difficulties of the Church. It had already become obvious
to them that it would be impossible to restrain the impulse arising from
the vigorous movements of the Saracens, and that it was absolutely
necessary so to order things that the actual condition of faith in Europe
might be accommodated to or even harmonized with these philosophical
conceptions, which it was quite clear would, soon or late, pervade the
whole Continent. This, as we have seen, is the explanation of the  <span class="pag">[132]</span>
introduction <a id="of132"></a>of Scholasticism from the Arabian schools, and its
accommodation to the Christian code, on which authority looked with so
much favour at first. But hardly had this attempt been entered upon
before it became manifest that the risks to be incurred through the
remedy itself were as great as the anticipated dangers. There was then no
other course than for the Church to retrace her steps, ostensibly
maintaining her consistency by permitting scholastic literature, though
declining scholastic theology. She thus allured the active intellect,
arising in all directions in the universities, to fruitless and visionary
pursuits. This policy, therefore, threw her back upon a system of
repression; it was the only course possible; yet there can be no doubt
that it was entered upon with reluctance.
<span class="side">The difficulty was in the system, not in the men.</span>
We do injustice to the great
men who guided ecclesiastical policy in those times when we represent
them as recklessly committing themselves to measures at once violent and
indefensible. They did make the attempt to institute an opposite policy;
it proved not only a failure, but mischievous. They were then driven to
check the spread of knowledge&mdash;driven by the necessities of their
position. The fault was none of theirs; it dated back to the time of
Constantine the Great; and the impossibility of either correcting or
neutralizing it is only an example, as has been said, of the manner in
which a general principle, once introduced, will overbear the best
exertions of those attempting to struggle against it. We can appreciate
the false position into which those statesmen were thrown when we compare
their personal with their public relations. Often the most eminent
persons lived in intimacy and friendship with Jewish physicians, who, in
the eye of the law, were enemies of society; often those who were
foremost in the cultivation of knowledge&mdash;who, indeed, suffered
excommunication for its sake&mdash;maintained amicable relations of a private
kind with those who in public were the leaders of their persecutors. The
systems were in antagonism, not the men. Arnold de Villa Nova, though
excommunicated, was the physician of one pope; Roger Bacon, though
harshly imprisoned, was the friend and correspondent of another. These
incidents are not to be mistaken for  <span class="pag">[133]</span> that <a id="compassion133"></a>compassion which the truly
great are ever ready to show to erring genius. They are examples of what
we often see in our own day, when men engaged in the movements of a great
political party loyally carry out its declared principles to their
consequences, though individually they may find in those consequences
many things to which they could mentally object. Their private objection
they thus yield for the sake of what appears to them, in a general way, a
practical good.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when the Arab element, having pervaded
France and Italy, made its formal intellectual attack. It might almost
have been foreseen in what manner that attack would be made, and the
shape it would be likely to assume. Of the sciences, astronomy was the
oldest and most advanced.
<span class="side">The intellectual impulse makes its attack through astronomy,</span>
Its beginning dates earlier than the historic
period, and both in India and in Egypt it had long reached correctness,
so far as its general principles were concerned. The Saracens had been
assiduous cultivators of it in both its branches, observation and
mathematical investigation. Upon one point, the figure and relations of
the earth, it is evident that not the slightest doubt existed among them.
Nay, it must be added that no learned European ecclesiastic or statesman
could deny the demonstrated truths. Nevertheless, it so fell out that
upon this very point the conflict broke out. In India the Brahmans had
passed through the same trial&mdash;for different nations walk through similar
paths&mdash;with a certain plausible success, by satisfying the popular
clamour that there was, in reality, nothing inconsistent between the
astronomical doctrine of the globular form and movement of the earth, and
the mythological dogma that it rests upon a succession of animals, the
lowest of which is a tortoise. But the strong common sense of Western
Europe was not to be deluded in any such idle way. It is not difficult to
see the point of contact, the point of pressure with the Church. The
abstract question gave her no concern; it was the consequences that might
possibly follow. The memorable battle was fought upon the question thus
sharply defined: Is the earth a moving globe, a small body in the midst
of suns and  <span class="pag">[134]</span> countless <a id="myriads134"></a>myriads of worlds, or is it the central and
greatest object in the universe, flat, and canopied over with a blue
dome, motionless while all is in movement around it?
<span class="side">and the Church is defeated.</span>
 The dispute thus
definitely put, its issue was such as must always attend a controversy in
which he who is defending is at once lukewarm and conscious of his own
weakness. Never can moral interests, however pure, stand against
intellect enforcing truth. On this ill-omened question the Church
ventured her battle and lost it.</p>


<p><span class="side"> The moral impulse. </span>Though this great conflict is embodied in the history of Galileo, who has
become its historical representative, the prime moving cause must not be
misunderstood. From the Pyrenees had passed forth an influence which had
infected all the learned men of Western Europe. Its tendency was
altogether unfavourable to the Church. Moreover, the illiterate classes
had been touched, but in a different way. To the first action the
designation of the intellectual impulse may be given; to the latter, the
moral. It is to be especially observed that in their directions these
impulses conspired.  We have seen how, through the Saracens and Jews
conjointly, the intellectual impulse came into play.
<span class="side"> Origin of the moral impulse.</span>
 The moral impulse
originated in a different manner, being due partly to the Crusades and
partly to the state of things in Rome. On these causes it is therefore
needful for us to reflect.</p>

<p>First, of the Crusades. There had been wrenched from Christendom its
fairest and most glorious portions. Spain, the north of Africa, Egypt,
Syria, Asia Minor, were gone. The Mohammedans had been repeatedly under
the walls of Constantinople; its fall was only a question of time. They
had been in the streets of Rome. They had marched across Italy in every
direction. <span class="side">Loss of the holy places. </span>
 But perhaps the geographical losses, appalling as they were,
did not appear so painful as the capture of the holy places; the
birth-place of our Redeemer; the scene of His sufferings; the Mount of
Olives; the Sea of Galilee; the Garden of Gethsemane; Calvary; the
Sepulchre. Too often in their day of strength, while there were Roman
legions at their back, had the bishops taunted Paganism with  <span class="pag">[135]</span> the
<a id="weakness135"></a>weakness of its divinities, who could not defend themselves, their
temples, or their sacred places. That logic was retaliated now. To many a
sincere heart must many an ominous reflexion have occurred. In Western
Europe there was a strong common sense which quickly caught the true
position of things&mdash;a common sense that could neither be blinded nor
hoodwinked. The astuteness of the Italian politicians was insufficient to
conceal altogether the great fact, though it might succeed in dissembling
its real significance for a time. The Europe of that day was very
different from the Europe of ours. It was in its Age of Faith. Recently
converted, as all recent converts do, it made its belief a living rule of
action. In our times there is not upon that continent a nation which, in
its practical relations with others, carries out to their consequences
its ostensible, its avowed articles of belief. Catholics, Protestants,
Mohammedans, they of the Greek communion, indiscriminately consort
together under the expediences of the passing hour. Statesmanship has
long been dissevered from religion&mdash;a fact most portentous for future
times. But it was not so in the Middle Ages. Men then believed their form
of faith with the same clearness, the same intensity with which they
believed their own existence or the actual presence of things upon which
they cast their eyes. The doctrines of the Church were to them no mere
inconsequential affair, but an absolute, an actual reality, a living and
a fearful thing. It would have passed their comprehension if they could
have been assured that a day would come when Christian Europe, by a
breath, could remove from the holy places the scandal of an infidel
intruder, but, upon the whole, would consider it not worth her while to
do so. How differently they acted. <span class="side">Effect of the Crusades. </span>
When, by the preaching of Peter the Hermit and his collaborators, who had received a signal from Rome, a
knowledge had come to their ears of the reproach that had befallen
Jerusalem and the sufferings of the pilgrims, their plain but
straightforward common sense taught them at once what was the right
remedy to apply, and forthwith they did apply it, and Christendom,
precipitated headlong upon the Holy Land, was brought face to face with
Mohammedanism. But what a scene awaited the  <span class="pag">[136]</span> zealous, <a id="the136"></a>the religious
barbarians&mdash;for such they truly were&mdash;when Constantinople, with its
matchless splendours, came in view! What a scene when they had passed
into Asia Minor, that garden of the world, presenting city after city,
with palaces and edifices, the pride of twenty centuries!
<span class="side">Change of opinion in the Crusaders.</span> How unexpected
the character of those Saracens, whom they had been taught, by those who
had incited them to their enterprise, to regard as no better than
bloodthirsty fiends, but whom they found valiant, merciful, just! When
Richard the Lion-hearted, King of England, lay in his tent consumed by a
fever, there came into the camp camels laden with snow, sent by his
enemy, the Sultan Saladin, to assuage his disease, the homage of one
brave soldier to another. But when Richard was returning to England, it
was by a Christian prince that he was treacherously seized and secretly
confined. This was doubtless only one of many such incidents which had
often before occurred. Even down to the meanest camp-follower, every one
must have recognized the difference between what they had anticipated and
what they had found. They had seen undaunted courage, chivalrous bearing,
intellectual culture far higher than their own. They had been in lands
filled with the prodigies of human skill. They did not melt down into the
populations to whom they returned without imparting to them a profound
impression destined to make itself felt in the course of time.</p>


<p><span class="side">They discover the immoralities of Italy.</span>But, secondly, as to the state of things in Rome. The movement into which
all Europe had been thrown by these wars brought to light the true
condition of things in Italy as respects morality. Locomotion in a
population is followed by intellectual development. The old stationary
condition of things in Europe was closed by the Crusades. National
movement gave rise to better observation, better information, and could
not but be followed by national reflexion. And though we are obliged to
speak of the European population as being in one sense in a barbarous
state, it was a moral population, earnestly believing the truth of every
doctrine it had been taught, and sincerely expecting that those doctrines
would be carried to  <span class="pag">[137]</span> their <a id="practical137"></a>practical application, and that religious
profession must, as a matter of course, be illustrated by religious life.
The Romans themselves were an exception to this. They had lived too long
behind the scenes. Indeed, it may be said that all the Italian peninsula
had emancipated itself from that delusion, as likewise certain classes in
France, who had become familiar with the state of things during the
residence of the popes at Avignon. It has been the destiny of Southern
France to pass, on a small scale, under the same influence, and to
exhibit the same results as were appointed for all Europe at last.</p>

<p>And now, what was it that awakening Europe found to be the state of
things in Italy? I avert my eyes from looking again at the biography of
the popes; it would be only to renew a scene of sin and shame. Nor can I,
without injustice to truth, speak of the social condition of the
inhabitants of that peninsula without relating facts which would compel
my reader to turn over the page with a blush. I prefer to look at the
maxims of political life which had been followed for many centuries, and
which were first divulged by one of the greatest men that Italy has
produced, in a work&mdash;<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1513&mdash;truly characterized as a literary
prodigy. Certainly nothing can surpass in atrocity the maxims therein
laid down.</p>


<p><span class="side">The principles of Italian statesmanship&mdash;Machiavelli.</span>Machiavelli,
 in that work, tells us that there are three degrees of
capacity among men. That one understands things by his own natural
powers; another, when they are explained to him; a third, not at all. In
dealing with these different classes different methods must be used. The
last class, which is by far the most numerous, is so simple and weak that
it is very easy to dupe those who belong to it. If they cease to believe
of their own accord they ought to be constrained by force, in the
application of which, though there may be considerable difficulties at
first, yet, these once overcome by a sufficient
unscrupulousness&mdash;veneration, security, tranquillity, and happiness will
follow. That, if a prince is constrained to make his choice, it is better
for him to be feared than loved; he should remember that all men are
ungrateful, fickle, timid, dissembling, and self-interested; that love
depends on them, but fear  <span class="pag">[138]</span> depends <a id="on138"></a>on him, and hence it is best to prefer
the latter, which is always in his own hands. The great aim of
statesmanship should be permanence, which is worth everything else, being
far more valuable than freedom. That, if a man wants to ruin a republic,
his proper course is to set it on bold undertakings, which it is sure to
mismanage; that men, being naturally wicked, incline to good only when
they are compelled; they think a great deal more of the present than the
past, and never seek change so long as they are made comfortable.</p>

<p>He recommends a ruler to bear in mind that, while the lower class of men
may desert him, the superior will not only desert, but conspire. If such
cannot with certainty be made trustworthy friends, it is very clearly
necessary to put it out of their power to be enemies. Thus it may be
observed that the frequent insurrections in Spain, Gaul, and Greece
against the Romans were entirely due to the petty chiefs inhabiting those
countries; but that, after these had been put to death, everything went
on very well. Up to a certain point, it should be the grand maxim of a
wise government to content the people and to manage the nobles; but that,
since hatred is just as easily incurred by good actions as by bad ones,
there will occasionally arise the necessity of being wicked in order to
maintain power, and, in such a case, there should be no hesitation; for,
though it is useful to persevere in the path of rectitude while there is
no inconvenience, we should deviate from it at once if circumstances so
advise. A prudent prince ought not keep his word to his own injury; he
ought to bear in mind that one who always endeavours to act as duty
dictates necessarily insures his own destruction; that new obligations
never extinguish the memory of former injuries in the minds of the
superior order of men; that liberality, in the end, generally insures
more enemies than friends; that it is the nature of mankind to become as
much attached to one by the benefits they render as by the favours they
receive; that, where the question is as to the taking of life or the
confiscation of property, it is useful to remember that men forget the
death of their relatives, but not the loss of their patrimony; that, if
cruelties should become expedient, they should be  <span class="pag">[139]</span> committed <a id="thoroughly139"></a>thoroughly
and but once&mdash;it is very impolitic to resort to them a second time; that
there are three ways of deciding any contest&mdash;by fraud, by force, or by
law, and a wise man will make the most suitable choice; that there are
also three ways of maintaining control in newly-conquered states that
have once been free&mdash;by ruining them, by inhabiting them, or by
permitting them to keep their own laws and to pay tribute. Of these the
first will often be found the best, as we may see from the history of the
Romans, who were experienced judges of such cases. That, as respects the
family of a rival but conquered sovereign, the greatest pains should be
taken to extinguish it completely; for history proves, what many fabulous
traditions relate, that dangerous political consequences have originated
in the escape of some obscure or insignificant member; that men of the
highest order, who are, therefore, of sound judgment&mdash;who seek for actual
social truths for their guidance rather than visionary models which never
existed&mdash;will conform to the decisions of reason, and never be influenced
by feelings of sentiment, unless it is apparent that some collateral
advantage will arise from the temporary exhibition thereof; and that they
will put a just estimate on the delusions in which the vulgar indulge,
casting aside the so-called interventions of Divine Providence, which
are, in reality, nothing more than the concatenation of certain
circumstances following the ordinary law of cause and effect, but which,
by interfering with the action of each other, have assumed a direction
which the judgment of the wisest could not have foreseen.</p>

<p>Europe has visited with its maledictions the great political writer by
whom these atrocious maxims have been recommended, forgetting that his
offence consists not in inventing, but in divulging them. His works thus
offer the purest example we possess of physical statesmanship. They are
altogether impassive. He views the management of a state precisely as he
might do the construction of a machine, recommending that such a wheel or
such a lever should be introduced, his only inquiry being whether it will
accomplish his intention. As to any happiness or misery it may work, he
  <span class="pag">[140]</span> gives <a id="himself140"></a>himself no concern, unless, indeed, they evidently ought to enter
into the calculation. He had suffered the rack himself under a charge of
conspiracy, and borne it without flinching. But, before Machiavelli
wrote, his principles had all been carried into practice; indeed, it
would not be difficult to give abundant examples in proof of the
assertion that they had been for ages regarded in Italy as rules of
conduct.</p>


<p><span class="side">Conjoined effect of the intellectual and moral impulses.</span>Such was the morality which Europe detected as existing in Italy, carried
out with inconceivable wickedness in public and private life; and thus
the two causes we have been considering&mdash;contact with the Saracens in
Syria and a knowledge of the real state of things in Rome&mdash;conspired
together to produce what may be designated as the moral impulse, which,
in its turn, conspired with the intellectual. Their association foreboded
evil to ecclesiastical authority, thus taken at great disadvantage.
Though, from its very birthday, that authority had been in absolute
opposition to the intellectual movement, it might, doubtless, for a much
longer time have successfully maintained its conflict therewith had the
conditions remained unchanged. Up to this time its chief strength reposed
upon its moral relations. It could point, and did point the attention of
those whose mental culture enabled them to understand the true position
of affairs, to Europe brought out of barbarism, and beginning a course of
glorious civilization. That achievement was claimed by the Church. If it
were true that she had thus brought it to pass, it had been altogether
wrought by the agency of her moral power, intellectual influence in no
manner aiding therein, but being uniformly, from the time of Constantine
the Great to that of the Reformation, instinctively repulsed. When, now,
the moral power suffered so great a shock, and was not only ready to go
over to, but had actually allied itself with the intellectual, there was
great danger to ecclesiastical authority. And hence we need not be
surprised that an impression began to prevail among the clear-thinking
men of the time that the real functions of that authority were completed
in producing the partially-civilized condition to which Europe had
attained, the course of  <span class="pag">[141]</span> events <a id="tending141"></a>tending evidently to an elimination of
that authority as an active element in the approaching European system.
<span class="side">The excuses of ecclesiasticism. </span>
To such the Church might emphatically address herself, pointing out the
signal and brilliant results to which she had given rise, and displaying
the manifest evils which must inevitably ensue if her relations, as then
existing, should be touched. For it must have been plain that the first
effect arising from the coalition of the intellectual with the moral
element would be an assertion of the right of private judgment in the
individual&mdash;a condition utterly inconsistent with the dominating
influence of authority. It was actually upon that very principle that the
battle of the Reformation was eventually fought. She might point out&mdash;for
it needed no prophetic inspiration&mdash;that, if once this principle was
yielded, there could be no other issue in Christendom than a total
decomposition; that though, for a little while, the separation might be
limited to a few great confessions, these, under the very influence of
the principle that had brought themselves into existence, must, in their
turn, undergo disintegration, and the end of it be a complete anarchy of
sects.
<span class="side">Her feeble resistance.</span>
 In one sense it may be said that it was in wisdom that the Church
took her stand upon this point, determining to make it her base of
resistance; unwisely in another, for it was evident that she had already
lost the initiative of action, and that her very resistance would
constitute the first stage in the process of decomposition.</p>


<p><span class="side">Contemporaneous changes in Europe.</span>Europe had made a vast step during its Age of Faith. Spontaneously it had
grown through its youth; and the Italians, who had furnished it with many
of its ideas, had furnished it also with many of its forms of life. In
that respect justice has still to be done them. When Rome broke away from
her connexions with Constantinople, a cloud of more than Cimmerian
darkness overshadowed Europe. It was occupied by wandering savages. Six
hundred years organized it into families, neighbourhoods, cities. Those
centuries found it full of bondmen; they left it without a slave. They
found it a scene of violence, rapine, lust; they left it the abode of
God-fearing men. Where there had  <span class="pag">[142]</span> been <a id="trackless142"></a>trackless forests, there were
innumerable steeples glittering in the sun; where there had been bloody
chieftains, drinking out of their enemies' skulls, there were grave
ecclesiastics, fathoming the depths of free-will, predestination,
election. Investing the clergy with a mysterious superiority, the Church
asserted the equality of the laity from the king to the beggar before
God. It disregarded wealth and birth, and opened a career for all. Its
influence over the family and domestic relations was felt through all
classes. It fixed paternity by a previous ceremony; it enforced the rule
that a wife passes into the family of her husband, and hence it followed
that legitimate children belong to the father, illegitimate to the
mother. It compelled women to domestic life, shut them out from the
priesthood, and tried to exclude them from government. In a worldly
sense, the mistake that Rome committed was this: she attempted to
maintain an intellectual immobility in the midst of an advancing social
state. She saw not that society could no more be stopped in its career
through her mere assertion that it could not and should not move, than
that the earth could be checked in its revolution merely because she
protested that it was at rest. She tried, first by persuasion and then by
force, to arrest the onward movement, but she was overborne,
notwithstanding her frantic resistance, by the impetuous current. Very
different would it have been had the Italian statesmen boldly put
themselves in the van of progress, and, instead of asserting an
immutability and infallibility, changed their dogmas and maxims as the
progress of events required. Europe need not have waited for Arabs and
Jews.</p>


<p><span class="side">Loss of power in Church organizations. </span>In describing these various facts, I have endeavoured to point out
impressively how the Church, so full of vigour at first, contained within
itself the seeds of inevitable decay. From the period when it came into
collision with the intellectual and moral elements, the origin of which
we have traced, and which conspired together for its overthrow, it
exhibited a gradual decline; first losing its influence upon nations, and
ceasing to be in them a principle of public action; next, witnessing the
alienation of the higher and  <span class="pag">[143]</span> educated <a id="classes143"></a>classes, the process descending
downward through the social scale, therein retracing the steps of its
advance. When ecclesiasticism became so weak as to be unable to regulate
international affairs, and was supplanted by diplomacy, in the castle the
physician was more than a rival for the confessor, in the town the mayor
was a greater man than the abbot. There remained a lingering influence
over individuals, who had not yet risen above a belief that it could
control their state after death. This decline of its ancient influence
should be a cause of rejoicing to all intelligent men, for an
ecclesiastical organization allying itself to political power can never
now be a source of any good. In America we have seen the bond that held
the Church and State together abruptly snapped.
<span class="side">Return of things to the ancient Christian times.</span>
 It is therefore well
that, since the close of the Age of Faith, things have been coming back
with an accelerated pace, to the state in which they were in the early
Christian times, before the founder of Constantinople beguiled the
devotional spirit to his personal and family benefit&mdash;to the state in
which they were before ambitious men sought political advancement and
wealth by organizing hypocrisy&mdash;when maxims of morality, charity,
benevolence, were rules of life for individual man&mdash;when the monitions of
conscience were obeyed without the suggestions of an outward, often an
interested and artful prompter&mdash;when the individual lived not under the
sleepless gaze, the crushing hand of a great overwhelming hierarchical
organization, surrounding him on all sides, doing his thinking for him,
directing him in his acts, making him a mere automaton, but in
simplicity, humility, and truthfulness guiding himself according to the
light given him, and discharging the duties of this troublesome and
transitory life "as ever in his great Taskmaster's eye."</p>

<p>For the progressive degradations exhibited by the Roman Church during the
Age of Faith, something may be offered as at once an explanation and an
excuse. Machiavelli relates, in his "History of Florence"&mdash;a work which,
if inferior in philosophical penetration to his "Prince," is of the most
singular merit as a literary composition&mdash;that Osporco, a Roman, having
become pope, exchanged  <span class="pag">[144]</span> his <a id="unseemly144"></a>unseemly name for the more classical one
Sergius, and that his successors have ever since observed the practice of
assuming a new name.
<span class="side">Connexion of religious ideas in Italy with its ethnical state.</span>
This incident profoundly illustrates the psychical
progress of that Church. During the fifteen centuries that we have had
under consideration&mdash;counting from a little before the Christian era&mdash;the
population of Italy had been constantly changing. The old Roman ethnical
element had become eliminated partly through the republican and imperial
wars, and partly through the slave system. The degenerated half-breeds,
of whom the Peninsula was full through repeated northern immigrations,
degenerated, as time went on, still more and more. After that blood
admixture had for the most part ceased, it took a long time for the base
ethnical element which was its product to come into physiological
correspondence with the country, for the adaptation of man to a new
climate is a slow, a secular change.</p>

<p>But blood-degeneration implies thought-degeneration. It is nothing more
than might be expected that, in this mongrel race, customs, and language,
and even names should change&mdash;that rivers, and towns, and men should
receive new appellations. As the great statesman to whom I have referred
observes, Cæsar and Pompey had disappeared; John, Matthew, and Peter had
come in their stead. Barbarized names are the outward and visible signs
of barbarized ideas. Those early bishops of Rome whose dignified acts
have commanded our respect, were men of Roman blood, and animated with
sentiments that were truly Latin; but the succeeding pontiffs, whose
lives were so infamous and thoughts so base, were engendered of
half-breeds. Nor was it until the Italian population had re-established
itself in a physiological relation with the country&mdash;not until it had
passed through the earlier stages of national life&mdash;that manly thoughts
and true conceptions could be regained.</p>

<p>Ideas and dogmas that would not have been tolerated for an instant in the
old, pure, homogeneous Roman race, found acceptance in this adulterated,
festering mass. This was the true cause of the increasing debasement of
Latin Christianity. Whoever will take the trouble of  <span class="pag">[145]</span> constructing a
<a id="chart145"></a>chart of the religious conceptions as they successively struggled into
light, will see how close was their connexion with the physiological
state of the Italian ethnical element at the moment.
<span class="side">Successive steps in the religious decline.</span>
 It is a sad and
humiliating succession. Mariolatry; the invocation of saints; the supreme
value of virginity; the working of miracles by relics; the satisfaction
of moral crimes by gifts of money or goods to the clergy; the worship of
images; Purgatory; the sale of benefices; transubstantiation, or the
making of God by the priest; the materialization of God&mdash;that He has
eyes, feet, hands, toes; the virtue of pilgrimages; vicarious religion,
the sinner paying the priest to pray for him; the corporeality of
spirits; the forbidding of the Bible to the laity; the descent to
shrine-worship and fetichism; the doctrine that man can do more than his
duty, and hence have a claim upon God; the sale by the priests of
indulgences in sin for money.</p>

<p>But there is another, a very different aspect under which we must regard
this Church. Enveloped as it was with the many evils of the times, the
truly Christian principle which was at its basis perpetually vindicated
its power, giving rise to numberless blessings in spite of the
degradation and wickedness of man.
<span class="side">Statement of what the Church had actually done.</span>
As I have elsewhere (Physiology, Book
II., Chap.&nbsp;VIII.) remarked, "The civil law exerted an exterior power in
human relations; Christianity produced an interior and moral change. The
idea of an ultimate accountability for personal deeds, of which the old
Europeans had an indistinct perception, became intense and precise. The
sentiment of universal charity was exemplified not only in individual
acts, the remembrance of which soon passes away, but in the more
permanent institution of establishments for the relief of affliction, the
spread of knowledge, the propagation of truth. Of the great
ecclesiastics, many had risen from the humblest ranks of society, and
these men, true to their democratic instincts, were often found to be the
inflexible supporters of right against might. Eventually coming to be the
depositaries of the knowledge that then existed, they opposed intellect
to brute force, in many instances successfully, and by  <span class="pag">[146]</span> the <a id="example146"></a>example of
the organization of the Church, which was essentially republican, they
showed how representative systems may be introduced into the state. Nor
was it over communities and nations that the Church displayed her chief
power. Never in the world before was there such a system. From her
central seat at Rome, her all-seeing eye, like that of Providence itself,
could equally take in a hemisphere at a glance, or examine the private
life of any individual. Her boundless influences enveloped kings in their
palaces, and relieved the beggar at the monastery gate. In all Europe
there was not a man too obscure, too insignificant, or too desolate for
her. Surrounded by her solemnities, every one received his name at her
altar; her bells chimed at his marriage, her knell tolled at his funeral.
She extorted from him the secrets of his life at her confessionals, and
punished his faults by her penances. In his hour of sickness and trouble
her servants sought him out, teaching him, by her exquisite litanies and
prayers, to place his reliance on God, or strengthening him for the
trials of life by the example of the holy and just. Her prayers had an
efficacy to give repose to the souls of his dead. When, even to his
friends, his lifeless body had become an offence, in the name of God she
received it into her consecrated ground, and under her shadow he rested
till the great reckoning-day. From little better than a slave she raised
his wife to be his equal, and, forbidding him to have more than one, met
her recompense for those noble deeds in a firm friend at every fireside.
Discountenancing all impure love, she put round that fireside the
children of one mother, and made that mother little less than sacred in
their eyes. In ages of lawlessness and rapine, among people but a step
above savages, she vindicated the inviolability of her precincts against
the hand of power, and made her temples a refuge and sanctuary for the
despairing and oppressed. Truly she was the shadow of a great rock in
many a weary land!"</p>


<p><span class="side">Analysis of the career of the Church.</span>This being the point which I consider the end of the Italian system as a
living force in European progress, its subsequent operation being
directed to the senses and not to the understanding, it will not be  <span class="pag">[147]</span> amiss
if for a <a id="moment147"></a>moment we extend our view to later times and to circumstances
beyond the strict compass of this book, endeavouring thus to ascertain
the condition of the Church, especially as to many devout persons it may
doubtless appear that she has lost none of her power.</p>


<p><span class="side">Four revolts against the Italian system.</span>On four occasions there have been revolts against the Italian Church
system: 1st, in the thirteenth century, the Albigensian; 2nd, in the
fourteenth, the Wiclifite; 3rd, in the sixteenth, the Reformation; 4th,
in the eighteenth, at the French Revolution. On each of these occasions
ecclesiastical authority has exerted whatever offensive or defensive
power it possessed. Its action is a true indication of its condition at
the time. Astronomers can determine the orbit of a comet or other
celestial meteor by three observations of its position as seen from the
earth, and taken at intervals apart.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Albigensian revolt.</span>1st. Of the Albigensian revolt. We have ascertained that the origin of
this is distinctly traceable to the Mohammedan influence of Spain,
through the schools of Cordova and Granada, pervading Languedoc and
Provence. Had these agencies produced only the gay scenes of chivalry and
courtesy as their material results, and, as their intellectual,
war-ballads, satires, and amorous songs, they had been excused; but,
along with such elegant frivolities, there was something of a more
serious kind. A popular proverb will often betray national belief, and
there was a proverb in Provence, "Viler than a priest." The offensive
sectaries also quoted, for the edification of the monks, certain texts,
to the effect that, "if a man will not work neither let him eat." The
event, in the hands of Simon de Montfort, taught them that there is such
a thing as wresting Scripture to one's own destruction.</p>

<p>How did the Church deal with this Albigensian heresy? As those do who
have an absolutely overwhelming power. She did not crush it&mdash;that would
have been too indulgent; she absolutely annihilated it. Awake to what
must necessarily ensue from the imperceptible spread of such opinions,
she remorselessly consumed its birth-place with fire and sword; and,
fearful that some fugitives might have  <span class="pag">[148]</span> escaped <a id="her148"></a>her vigilant eye, or that
heresy might go wherever a bale of goods might be conveyed, she organized
the Inquisition with its troops of familiars and spies. Six hundred years
have elapsed since these events, and the south of France has never
recovered from the blow.</p>

<p>That was a persecution worthy of a sovereign&mdash;a persecution conducted on
sound Italian principles of policy&mdash;to consider clearly the end to be
attained, and adopt the proper means without any kind of concern as to
their nature. But it was a persecution that implied the possession of
unlimited and irresponsible power.</p>


<p><span class="side">The revolt of Wiclif.</span>2nd. Of the revolt of Wiclif. We have also considered the state of
affairs which aroused the resistance of Wiclif. It is manifested by legal
enactments early in the fourteenth century, such as that ecclesiastics
shall not go armed, nor join themselves with thieves, nor frequent
taverns, nor chambers of strumpets, nor visit nuns, nor play at dice, nor
keep concubines&mdash;by the Parliamentary bill of 1376, setting forth that
the tax paid in England to the pope for ecclesiastical dignities is
fourfold as much as that coming to the king from the whole realm; that
alien clergy, who have never seen nor care to see their flocks, convey
away the treasure of the country&mdash;by the homely preaching of John Ball,
that all men are equal in the sight of God. Wiclif's opposition was not
only directed against corruptions of discipline in the Church, but
equally against doctrinal errors. His dogma that "God bindeth not men to
believe any thing they cannot understand" is a distinct embodiment of the
rights of reason, and the noble purpose he carried into execution of
translating the Bible from the Vulgate shows in what direction he
intended the application of that doctrine to be made. Through the
influence of the queen of Richard the Second, who was a native of that
country, his doctrines found an echo in Bohemia&mdash;Huss not only earnestly
adopting his theological views, but also joining in his resistance to the
despotism of the court of Rome and his exposures of the corruptions of
the clergy. The political point of this revolt in England occurs in the
refusal of Edward&nbsp;III., at the instigation of Wiclif, to do homage to the
pope; the religious, in the translation of the Bible.</p>

<p>  <span class="pag">[149]</span> <a id="Though149"></a>Though a bull was sent to London requiring the arch-heretic to be seized
and put in irons, Wiclif died in his bed, and his bones rested quietly in
the grave for forty-four years. Ecclesiastical vengeance burned them at
last, and scattered them to the winds.</p>

<p>There was no remissness in the ecclesiastical authority, but there were
victories won by the blind hero, John Zisca. After the death of that
great soldier&mdash;whose body was left by the road-side to the wolves and
crows, and his skin dried and made into a drum&mdash;in vain was all that
perfidy could suggest and all that brutality could execute resorted
to&mdash;in vain the sword and fire were passed over Bohemia, and the last
effort of impotent vengeance tried in England&mdash;the heretics could not be
exterminated nor the detested translation of the Bible destroyed.</p>


<p><span class="side">The revolt of Luther.</span>3rd. Of the revolt of Luther. As we shall have, in a subsequent chapter,
to consider the causes that led to the Reformation, it is not necessary
to anticipate them in any detail here. The necessities of the Roman
treasury, which suggested the doctrine of supererogation and the sale of
indulgences as a ready means of relief, merely brought on a crisis which
otherwise could not have been long postponed, the real point at issue
being the right of interpretation of the Scriptures by private judgment.</p>

<p>The Church did not restrict her resistance to the use of ecclesiastical
weapons&mdash;those of a carnal kind she also employed. Yet we look in vain
for the concentrated energy with which she annihilated the Albigenses, or
the atrocious policy with which the Hussites were met. The times no
longer permitted those things. But the struggle was maintained with
unflinching constancy through the disasters and successes of one hundred
and thirty years. Then came the peace of Westphalia, and the result of
the contest was ascertained. The Church had lost the whole of northern
Europe.</p>


<p><span class="side">The revolt of the philosophers.</span>4th. Of the revolt of the philosophers. Besides the actual loss of the
nations who openly fell away to Protestantism, a serious detriment was
soon found to have befallen those still remaining nominally faithful to
the Church. The fact of  <span class="pag">[150]</span> secession <a id="or150"></a>or adherence depending, in a monarchy,
on the personal caprice or policy of the sovereign, is by no means a true
index of the opinions or relations of the subjects; and thus it happened
that in several countries in which there was an outward appearance of
agreement with the Church because of the attitude of the government,
there was, in reality, a total disruption, so far as the educated and
thinking classes were concerned. This was especially the case in France.</p>

<p>When the voyage of circumnavigation of the globe by Magellan had for ever
settled all such questions as those of the figure of the earth and the
existence of the antipodes, the principles upon which the contest was
composed between the conflicting parties are obvious from the most
superficial perusal of the history of physics. Free thought was extorted
for science, and, as its equivalent, an unmolested state for theology. It
was an armed truce.</p>

<p>It was not through either of the parties to that conflict that new
troubles arose, but through the action of a class fast rising into
importance&mdash;literary men. From the beginning to the middle of the last
century these philosophers became more and more audacious in their
attacks. Unlike the scientific, whose theological action was by
implication rather than in a direct way, these boldly assaulted the
intellectual basis of faith. The opportune occurrence of the American
Revolution, by bringing forward in a prominent manner social evils and
political methods for their cure, gave a practical application to the
movement in Europe, and the Church was found unable to offer any kind of
resistance.</p>


<p><span class="side">Summary of the Italian system.</span>From these observations of the state of the Church at four different
epochs of her career we are able to determine her movement. There is a
time of abounding strength, a time of feebleness, a time of ruinous loss,
a time of utter exhaustion. What a difference between the eleventh and
the eighteenth centuries! It is the noontide and evening of a day of
empire.</p>

<p><span class="side">Peculiarities of the Age of Reason.</span>  <span class="pag">[151]</span>  I have arrived at the last division of my work, the period in national
life answering to maturity in individual. The objects to be considered
differ altogether from those which have hitherto occupied our attention.
We have now to find human authority promoting intellectual advancement,
and accepting as its maxim that the lot of man will be ameliorated, and
his power and dignity increased, in proportion as he is able to
comprehend the mechanism of the world, the action of natural laws, and to
apply physical forces to his use.</p>



<p><span class="side">Natural periods merge into one another.</span>The date at which this transition in European life was made will
doubtless be differently given according as the investigator changes his
point of view. In truth, there is not in national life any real epoch,
because there is nothing in reality  <span class="pag">[152]</span>  abrupt. <a id="Events152"></a>Events, however great or
sudden, are consequences of preparations long ago made. In this there is
a perfect parity between the course of national and that of individual
life. In the individual, one state merges by imperceptible degrees into
another, each in its beginning and end being altogether indistinct. No
one can tell at what moment he ceased to be a child and became a boy&mdash;at
what moment he ceased to be a youth and became a man. Each condition,
examined at a suitable interval, exhibits characteristics perfectly
distinctive, but, at their common point of contact, the two so overlap
and blend that, like the intermingling of shadow and light, the beginning
of one and end of the other may be very variously estimated.</p>


<p><span class="side">Artificial epochs.</span>In individual life, since no precise natural epoch exists, society has
found it expedient to establish an artificial one, as, for example, the
twenty-first year. The exigencies of history may be satisfied by similar
fictions. A classical critic would probably be justified in selecting for
his purpose the foundation of Constantinople as the epoch of the
commencement of the Age of Faith, and its capture by the Turks as the
close. It must be admitted that a very large number of historical events
stand in harmony with that arrangement.
<span class="side"> Origin and end of the Age of Faith.</span>
 A political writer would perhaps
be disposed to postpone the date of the latter epoch to that of the
treaty of Westphalia, for from that time theological elements ceased to
have a recognized force, Protestant, Catholic, Mohammedan, consorting
promiscuously together in alliance or at war, according as temporary
necessities might indicate. Besides these other artificial epochs might
be assigned, each doubtless having advantages to recommend it to notice.
But, after all, the chief peculiarity is obvious enough. It is the
gradual decline of a system that had been in activity for many ages, and
its gradual replacement by another.</p>


<p><span class="side">Prelude to the Age of Reason.</span>As with the Age of Reason in Greece, so with the Age of Reason in Europe,
there is a prelude marked by the gradual emergence of a sound philosophy;
a true logic displaces the supernatural; experiment supersedes
speculation. It is very interesting to trace the feeble beginnings of
modern science in alchemy  <span class="pag">[153]</span>  and <a id="natural153"></a>natural magic in countries where no one
could understand the writings of Alhazen or the Arabian philosophers. Out
of many names of those who took part in this movement that might be
mentioned there are some that deserve recollection.</p>


<p><span class="side">Albertus Magnus, the Dominican.</span>Albertus Magnus was born <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1193. It was said of him that "he was great
in magic, greater in philosophy, greatest in theology." By religious
profession he was a Dominican. Declining the temptations of
ecclesiastical preferment, he voluntarily resigned his bishopric, that he
might lead in privacy a purer life. As was not uncommon in those days, he
was accused of illicit commerce with Satan, and many idle stories were
told of the miracles he wrought. At a great banquet on a winter's day, he
produced all the beauties of spring&mdash;trees in full foliage, flowers in
perfume, meadows covered with grass; but, at a word, the phantom pageant
was dissolved, and succeeded by appropriate wastes of snow. This was an
exaggeration of an entertainment he gave, January 6th, 1259, in the
hot-house of the convent garden. He interested himself in the functions
of plants, was well acquainted with what is called the sleep of flowers,
studied their opening and closing. He understood that the sap is
diminished in volume by evaporation from the leaves. He was the first to
use the word "affinity" in its modern acceptation. His chemical studies
present us with some interesting details. He knew that the whitening of
copper by arsenic is not a transmutation, but only the production of an
alloy, since the arsenic can be expelled by heat. He speaks of potash as
an alkali; describes several acetates; and alludes to the blackening of
the skin with nitrate of silver.</p>


<p><span class="side">Roger Bacon, discoveries of.</span>Contemporary with him was Roger Bacon, born <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1214. His native country
has never yet done him justice, though his contemporaries truly spoke of
him as "the Admirable Doctor." The great friar of the thirteenth century
has been eclipsed by an unworthy namesake. His claims on posterity are
enforced by his sufferings and ten years' imprisonment for the cause of
truth.</p>

<p>His history, so far as is known, may be briefly  <span class="pag">[154]</span>  told. <a id="He154"></a>He was born at
Ilchester, in Somersetshire, and studied at the University of Oxford.
Thence he went to the University of Paris, where he took the degree of
doctor of theology. He was familiar with Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and
Arabic. Of mathematics he truly says that "it is the first of all the
sciences; indeed, it precedes all others, and disposes us to them." In
advance of his age, he denied the authority of Aristotle, and tells us
that we must substitute that of experiment for it. Of his astronomical
acquirements we need no better proof than his recommendation to Pope
Clement&nbsp;IV. to rectify the Calendar in the manner actually done
subsequently. If to him be rightly attributed the invention of
spectacles, the human race is his debtor. He described the true theory of
telescopes and microscopes, saying that lenses may be ground and arranged
in such a way as to render it possible to read the smallest letters at
incredible distances, and to count grains of sand and dust, because of
the magnitude of the angle under which we may perceive such objects. He
foresaw the greatest of all inventions in practical astronomy&mdash;the
application of optical means to instruments for the measurement of
angles. He proposed the propulsion of ships through the water and of
carriages upon roads by merely mechanical means. He speculated upon the
possibility of making a flying-machine. Admitting the truth of alchemy,
he advised the experimenter to find out the method by which Nature makes
metals and then to imitate it. He knew that there are different kinds of
air, and tells us that there is one which will extinguish flame. These
are very clear views for an age which mistook the gases for leather-eared
ghosts. He warned us to be cautious how we conclude that we have
accomplished the transmutation of metals, quaintly observing that the
distance between whitened copper and pure silver is very great. He showed
that air is necessary for the support of fire, and was the author of the
well-known experiment illustrating that fact by putting a lighted lamp
under a bell-jar and observing its extinction.</p>


<p><span class="side">Is persecuted and imprisoned.</span>There is no little significance in the expression of Friar Bacon that the
ignorant mind cannot sustain  <span class="pag">[155]</span>  the <a id="truth155"></a>truth. He was accused of magical
practices and of a commerce with Satan, though, during the life of
Clement&nbsp;IV., who was his friend, he escaped without public penalties.
This pope had written to him a request that he would furnish him an
account of his various inventions. In compliance therewith, Bacon sent
him the "Opus Majus" and other works, together with several mathematical
instruments which he had made with his own hands. But, under the
pontificate of Nicolas&nbsp;III., the accusation of magic, astrology, and
selling himself to the Devil was again pressed, one point being that he
had proposed to construct astronomical tables for the purpose of
predicting future events. Apprehending the worst, he tried to defend
himself by his work "De Nullitate Magiæ." "Because these things are
beyond your comprehension, you call them the works of the Devil; your
theologians and canonists abhor them as the productions of magic,
regarding them as unworthy of a Christian." But it was in vain. His
writings were condemned as containing dangerous and suspected novelties,
and he was committed to prison. There he remained for ten years, until,
broken in health, he was released from punishment by the intercession of
some powerful and commiserating personages. He died at the age of
seventy-eight. On his death-bed he uttered the melancholy complaint, "I
repent now that I have given myself so much trouble for the love of
science." If there be found in his works sentiments that are more
agreeable to the age in which he lived than to ours, let us recollect
what he says in his third letter to Pope Clement: "It is on account of
the ignorance of those with whom I have had to deal that I have not been
able to accomplish more."</p>


<p><span class="side">Minor alchemists of England, France, and Germany.</span>A number of less conspicuous though not unknown names succeed to Bacon.
There is Raymond Lully, who was said to have been shut up in the Tower of
London and compelled to make gold for Edward&nbsp;II.; Guidon de Montanor, the
inventor of the philosopher's balm; Clopinel, the author of the "Romance
of the Rose;" Richard the Englishman, who makes the sensible remark that
he who does not join theory to practice is like an ass eating hay and not
 <span class="pag">[156]</span>  reflecting <a id="on156"></a>on what he is doing; Master Ortholan, who describes very
prettily the making of nitric acid, and approaches to the preparation of
absolute alcohol under the title of the quintessence of wine; Bernard de
Treves, who obtained much reputation for the love-philters he prepared
for Charles&nbsp;V. of France, their efficacy having been ascertained by
experiments made on servant-girls; Bartholomew, the Englishman who first
described the method of crystallizing and purifying sugar; Eck de
Sulzbach, who teaches how metallic crystallizations, such as the tree of
Diana, a beautiful silvery vegetation, may be produced. He proved
experimentally that metals, when they oxidize, increase in weight; and
says that in the month of November, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1489, he found that six pounds
of an amalgam of silver heated for eight days augmented in weight three
pounds. The number is, of course, erroneous, but his explanation is very
surprising. "This augmentation of weight comes from this, that a spirit
is united with the metal; and what proves it is that this artificial
cinnabar, submitted to distillation, disengages that spirit." He was
within a hair's-breadth of anticipating Priestley and Lavoisier by three
hundred years.</p>


<p><span class="side">Augurelli, the poetical alchemist.</span>The alchemists of the sixteenth century not only occupied themselves with
experiment; some of them, as Augurelli, aspired to poetry. He undertook
to describe in Latin verses the art of making gold. His book, entitled
"Chrysop&oelig;ia," was dedicated to Leo&nbsp;X., a fact which shows the
existence of a greater public liberality of sentiment than heretofore. It
is said that the author expected the Holy Father to make him a handsome
recompense, but the good-natured pope merely sent him a large empty sack,
saying that he who knew how to make gold so admirably only needed a purse
to put it in.</p>


<p><span class="side">Basil Valentine introduces antimony.</span>The celebrated work of Basil Valentine, entitled "Currus triumphalis
Antimonii," introduced the metal antimony into the practice of medicine.
The attention of this author was first directed to the therapeutical
relations of the metal by observing that some swine, to which a portion
of it had been given, grew fat with surprising rapidity.  <span class="pag">[157]</span>  There <a id="were157"></a>were
certain monks in his vicinity who, during the season of Lent, had reduced
themselves to the last degree of attenuation by fasting and other
mortifications of the flesh. On these Basil was induced to try the powers
of the metal. To his surprise, instead of recovering their flesh and
fatness, they were all killed; hence the name popularly given to the
metal, antimoine, because it does not agree with the constitution of a
monk. Up to this time it had passed under the name of stibium. With a
result not very different was the application of antimony in the
composition of printer's type-metal. Administered internally or thus
mechanically used, this metal proved equally noxious to ecclesiastics.</p>


<p><span class="side">The new epoch.</span>It is scarcely necessary to continue the relation of these scientific
trifles. Enough has been said to illustrate the quickly-spreading taste
for experimental inquiry. I now hasten to the description of more
important things.</p>


<p><span class="side">Difficulty of treating it scientifically.</span>In the limited space of this book I must treat these subjects, not as
they should be dealt with philosophically, but in the manner that
circumstances permit. Even with this imperfection, their description
spontaneously assumes an almost dramatic form, the facts offering
themselves to all reflecting men with an air of surpassing dignity. On
one hand it is connected with topics the most sublime, on the other it
descends to incidents the most familiar and useful; on one hand it
elevates our minds to the relations of suns and myriads of worlds, on the
other it falls to the every-day acts of our domestic and individual life;
on one hand it turns our thoughts to a vista of ages so infinite that the
vanishing point is in eternity, on the other it magnifies into importance
the transitory occupation of a passing hour. Knowing how great are the
requirements for the right treatment of such topics, I might shrink from
this portion of my book with a conviction of incapacity. I enter upon it
with hesitation, trusting rather to the considerate indulgence of the

<p>In the history of the philosophical life of Greece, we have
seen <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31345/31345-h/31345-h.htm#Chapter_II">(Chapter&nbsp;II.)</a> how important were the  <span class="pag">[158]</span>  influences <a id="of158"></a>of maritime discovery and the
rise of criticism. Conjointly they closed the Greek Age of Faith. In the
life of Europe, at the point we have now reached, they came into action
again.
<span class="side">Approach of the Age of Reason.</span>
As on this occasion the circumstances connected with them are
numerous and important, I shall consider them separately in this and the
following chapter. And, first, of maritime enterprise, which was the
harbinger of the Age of Reason in Europe. It gave rise to three great
voyages&mdash;the discovery of America, the doubling of the Cape, and the
circumnavigation of the earth.</p>


<p><span class="side">State of Mediterranean trade.</span>At the time of which we are speaking, the commerce of the Mediterranean
was chiefly in two directions. The ports of the Black Sea furnished
suitable depôts for produce brought down the Tanaïs and other rivers, and
for a large portion of the India trade that had come across the Caspian.
The seat of this commerce was Genoa.</p>

<p>The other direction was the south-east. The shortest course to India was
along the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf, but the Red and Arabian seas
offered a cheaper and safer route. In the ports of Syria and Egypt were
therefore found the larger part of the commodities of India. This trade
centred in Venice. A vast development had been given to it through the
Crusades, the Venetians probably finding in the transport service of the
Holy Wars as great a source of profit as in the India trade.</p>


<p><span class="side">Rivalry of Genoa and Venice.</span>Toward the latter part of the fourteenth century it became apparent that
the commercial rivalry between Venice and Genoa would terminate to the
disadvantage of the latter. The irruption of the Tartars and invasion of
the Turks had completely dislocated her Asiatic lines of trade. In the
wars between the two republics Genoa had suffered severely. Partly for
this reason, and partly through the advantageous treaties that Venice had
made with the sultans, giving her the privilege of consulates at
Alexandria and Damascus, this republic had at last attained a supremacy
over all competitors. The Genoese establishments on the Black Sea had
become worthless.</p>


<p> <span class="side">Attempt to reach India by the west.</span><span class="pag">[159]</span>  <a id="With159"></a>With ruin before them, and unwilling to yield their Eastern connexions,
the merchants of Genoa had tried to retrieve their affairs by war; her
practical sailors saw that she might be re-established in another way.
There were among them some who were well acquainted with the globular
form of the earth, and with what had been done by the Mohammedan
astronomers for determining its circumference by the measurement of a
degree on the shore of the Red Sea. These men originated the attempt to
reach India by sailing to the west.</p>


<p><span class="side">Opposition to this scheme.</span>By two parties&mdash;the merchants and the clergy&mdash;their suggestions were
received with little favour. The former gave no encouragement, perhaps
because such schemes were unsuited to their existing arrangements; the
latter disliked them because of their suspected irreligious nature. The
globular form had been condemned by such fathers as Lactantius and
Augustine. In the Patristic Geography the earth is a flat surface
bordered by the waters of the sea, on the yielding support of which rests
the crystalline dome of the sky. These doctrines were for the most part
supported by passages from the Holy Scriptures, perversely wrested from
their proper meaning. Thus Cosmas Indicopleustes, whose Patristic
Geography had been an authority for nearly eight hundred years,
triumphantly disposed of the sphericity of the earth by demanding of its
advocates how in the day of judgment, men on the other side of a globe
could see the Lord descending through the air!</p>

<p>Among the Genoese sailors seeking the welfare of their city was one
destined for immortality&mdash;Christopher Columbus.</p>


<p><span class="side">Columbus, early life of.</span>His father was a wool-comber, yet not a man of the common sort. He
procured for his son a knowledge of arithmetic, drawing, painting; and
Columbus is said to have written a singularly beautiful hand. For a short
time he was at the University of Pavia, but he went to sea when he was
only fourteen. After being engaged in the Syrian trade for many years, he
had made several voyages to Guinea, occupying his time when not at sea in
the construction of charts for  <span class="pag">[160]</span>  sale, <a id="thereby160"></a>thereby supporting not only
himself, but also his aged father, and finding means for the education of
his brothers. Under these circumstances he had obtained a competent
knowledge of geography, and, though the state of public opinion at the
time did not permit such doctrines to be openly avowed, he believed that
the sea is everywhere navigable, that the earth is round and not flat,
that there are antipodes, that the torrid zone is habitable, and that
there is a proportionate distribution of land in the northern and
southern hemispheres.
<span class="side">His argument for lands to the west.</span>
Adopting the Patristic logic when it suited his
purpose, he reasoned that since the earth is made for man, it is not
likely that its surface is too largely covered with water, and that, if
there are lands, they must be inhabited, since the command was renewed at
the Flood that man should replenish the earth. He asked, "Is it likely
that the sun shines upon nothing, and that the nightly watches of the
stars are wasted on trackless seas and desert lands?" But to this
reasoning he added facts that were more substantial. One Martin Vincent,
who had sailed many miles to the west of the Azores, related to him that
he had found, floating on the sea, a piece of timber evidently carved
without iron. Another sailor, Pedro Correa, his brother-in-law, had met
with enormous canes. On the coast of Flores the sea had cast up two dead
men with large faces, of a strange aspect. Columbus appears to have
formed his theory that the East Indies could be reached by sailing to the
west about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1474. He was at that time in correspondence with
Toscanelli, the Florentine astronomer, who held the same doctrine, and
who sent him a map or chart constructed on the travels of Marco Polo. He
offered his services first to his native city, then to Portugal, then to
Spain, and, through his brother, to England; his chief inducement in each
instance being that the riches of India might be thus secured. In Lisbon
he had married. While he lay sick near Belem an unknown voice whispered
to him in a dream, "God will cause thy name to be wonderfully resounded
through the earth, and will give thee the keys of the gates of the ocean,
which are closed with strong chains!" The death of his wife appears to
have  <span class="pag">[161]</span> broken <a id="the161"></a>the last link which held him to Portugal, where he had been
since 1470. One evening, in the autumn of 1485, a man of majestic
presence, pale, care-worn, and, though in the meridian of life, with
silver hair, leading a little boy by the hand, asked alms at the gate of
the Franciscan convent near Palos&mdash;not for himself, but only a little
bread and water for his child. This was that Columbus destined to give to
Europe a new world.</p>


<p><span class="side">Is confuted by the Council of Salamanca.</span>In extreme poverty, he was making his way to the Spanish court. After
many wearisome delays his suit was referred to a council at Salamanca,
before which, however, his doctrines were confuted from the Pentateuch,
the Psalms, the Prophecies, the Gospels, the Epistles, and the writings
of the fathers&mdash;St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, St. Jerome, St. Gregory,
St. Basil, St. Ambrose. Moreover, they were demonstrably inconsistent
with reason; since, if even he should depart from Spain, "the rotundity
of the earth would present a kind of mountain up which it was impossible
for him to sail, even with the fairest wind;" and so he could never get
back. The Grand Cardinal of Spain had also indicated their irreligious
nature, and Columbus began to fear that, instead of receiving aid as a
discoverer, he should fall into trouble as a heretic.
<span class="side"> Queen Isabella adopts his views.</span>
However, after many
years of mortification and procrastination, he at length prevailed with
Queen Isabella; and on April 17, 1492, in the field before Granada, then
just wrenched from the Mohammedans by the arms of Ferdinand and Isabella,
he received his commission. With a nobleness of purpose, he desired no
reward unless he should succeed; but, in that case, stipulated that he
should have the title of Admiral and Viceroy, and that his perquisite
should be one tenth of all he should discover&mdash;conditions which show what
manner of man this great sailor was.
<span class="side">The expedition prepared.</span>
 He had bound himself to contribute
one-eighth to the expenses of the expedition: this he accomplished
through the Pinzons of Palos, an old and wealthy seafaring family. These
arrangements once ratified, he lost not a moment in completing the
preparations for his expedition. The royal authority enabled him to
take&mdash;forcibly, if necessary&mdash;both  <span class="pag">[162]</span> ships <a id="and162"></a>and men. But even with that
advantage he would hardly have succeeded if the Pinzons had not joined
heartily with him, personally sharing in the dangers of the voyage.</p>


<p><span class="side">The voyage across the Atlantic.</span>The sun, by journeying to the west, rises on India at last. On Friday,
August 3, 1492, the weary struggles and heart-sickness of eighteen years
of supplication were over, and, as the day was breaking, Columbus sailed
with three little ships from Palos, carrying with him charts constructed
on the basis of that which Toscanelli had formerly sent, and also a
letter to the Grand Khan of Tartary. On the 9th he saw the Canaries,
being detained among them three weeks by the provisioning and repairing
of his ships. He left them on September 6th, escaping the pursuit of some
caravels sent out by the Portuguese government to intercept him. He now
steered due west. Nothing of interest occurred until nightfall on
September 13th, when he remarked with surprise that the needle, which the
day before had pointed due north, was varying half a point to the west,
the effect becoming more and more marked as the expedition advanced. He
was now beyond the track of any former navigator, and with no sure guide
but the stars; the heaven was everywhere, and everywhere the sea. On
Sunday, 16th, he encountered many floating weeds, and picked up what was
mistaken for a live grasshopper. For some days the weeds increased in
quantity, and retarded the sailing of the ships. On the 19th two pelicans
flew on board. Thus far he had had an easterly wind; but on September
20th it changed to south-west, and many little birds, "such as those that
sing in orchards," were seen. His men now became mutinous, and reproached
the king and queen for trusting to "this bold Italian, who wanted to make
a great lord of himself at the price of their lives."</p>

<p>On September 25th Pinzon reported to him that he thought he saw land; but
it proved to be only clouds. With great difficulty he kept down his
mutinous crew. On October 2nd he observed the seaweeds drifting from east
to west. Pinzon, in the Pinta, having seen a flight of parrots going to
the south-west, the course was altered on October 7th, and he steered
after them west-south-west;  <span class="pag">[163]</span> he <a id="had163"></a>had hitherto been on the parallel 26°&nbsp;N.
On the evening of October 11h the signs of land had become so
unmistakable that, after vesper hymn to the Virgin, he made an address of
congratulation to his crew, and commended watchfulness to them.
<span class="side">Discovery of America.</span>
His course was now due west. A little before midnight, Columbus, on the
fore-castle of his ship, saw a moving light at a distance; and two hours
after a signal-gun was fired from the Pinta. A sailor, Rodrigo de Triana,
had descried land. The ships were laid to. As soon as day dawned they
made it out to be a verdant island. There were naked Indians upon the
beach watching their movements. At sunrise, October&nbsp;12, 1492, the boats
were manned and armed, and Columbus was the first European to set foot on
the new world.</p>


<p><span class="side">Events of the voyage.</span>The chief events of the voyage of Columbus were, 1st. The discovery of
the line of no magnetic variation, which, as we shall see, eventually led
to the circumnavigation of the earth. 2nd. The navigability of the sea to
the remote west, the weeds not offering any insuperable obstruction. When
the ships left Palos it was universally believed that the final border or
verge of the earth is where the western sky rests upon the sea, and the
air and clouds, fogs and water, are commingled. Indeed, that boundary
could not actually be attained; for, long before it was possible to reach
it, the sea was laden with inextricable weeds, through which a ship could
not pass. This legend was perhaps derived from the stories of adventurous
sailors, who had been driven by stress of weather towards the Sargasso
Sea, and seen an island of weeds many hundreds of square miles in
extent&mdash;green meadows floating in the ocean. 3rd. As to the new
continent, Columbus never knew the nature of his own discovery. He died
in the belief that it was actually some part of Asia, and Americus
Vespucius entertained the same misconception. Their immediate successors
supposed that Mexico was the Quinsay, in China, of Marco Polo. For this
reason I do not think that the severe remark that the "name of America is
a monument of human injustice" is altogether merited. Had the true state
of things been known, doubtless the event would have been different. The
name of  <span class="pag">[164]</span> America <a id="first164"></a>first occurs in an edition of Ptolemy's Geography, on a
map by Hylacomylus.</p>


<p><span class="side">End of Patristic Geography.</span>Two other incidents of no little interest followed this successful
voyage: the first was the destruction of Patristic Geography; the second
the consequence of the flight of Pinzon's parrots. Though, as we now
know, the conclusion that India had been reached was not warranted by the
facts, it was on all sides admitted that the old doctrine was overthrown,
and that the admiral had reached Asia by sailing to the west. This
necessarily implied the globular form of the earth. As to the second,
never was an augury more momentous than that flight of parrots. It has
been well said that this event determined the distribution of Latin and
German Christianity in the New World.</p>


<p><span class="side">Previous Scandinavian discovery.</span>The discovery of America by Leif, the son of Eric the Red, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1000,
cannot diminish the claims of Columbus. The wandering Scandinavians had
reached the shores of America first in the vicinity of Nantucket, and had
given the name of Vinland to the region extending from beyond Boston to
the south of New York. But the memory of these voyages seems totally to
have passed away, or the lands were confounded with Greenland, to which
Nicolas&nbsp;V. had appointed a bishop <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1448. Had these traditions been
known to or respected by Columbus, he would undoubtedly have steered his
ships more to the north.</p>


<p><span class="side">The papal grant to Spain.</span>Immediately on the return of Columbus, March 15, 1493, the King and Queen
of Spain despatched an ambassador to Pope Alexander&nbsp;VI. for the purpose
of insuring their rights to the new territories, on the same principle
that Martin&nbsp;V. had already given to the King of Portugal possession of
all lands he might discover between Cape Bojador and the East Indies,
with plenary indulgence for the souls of those who perished in the
conquest. The pontifical action was essentially based on the principle
that pagans and infidels have no lawful property in their lands and
goods, but that the children of God may rightfully take them away. The
bull that was issued bears date May, 1493. Its principle is, that all
countries under the sun are subject of right to papal  <span class="pag">[165]</span> disposal. <a id="It165"></a>It gives
to Spain, in the fulness of apostolic power, all lands west and south of
a line drawn from the Arctic to the Antarctic pole, one hundred leagues
west of the Azores. The donation includes, by the authority of Almighty
God, whatever there is toward India, but saves the existing rights of any
Christian princes. It forbids, under pain of excommunication, any one
trading in that direction, threatening the indignation of Almighty God
and his holy apostles Peter and Paul. It directs the barbarous nations to
be subdued, and no pains to be spared for reducing the Indians to
Christianity.</p>


<p><span class="side">The magnetic line of no variation.</span>This suggestion of the line of no magnetic variation was due to Columbus,
who fell into the error of supposing it to be immovable. The
infallibility of the pontiff not extending to matters of science, he
committed the same mistake. In a few years it was discovered that the
line of no variation was slowly moving to the east. It coincided with the
meridian of London in 1662.</p>


<p><span class="side"> Patristic ethnical ideas.</span>The obstacles that Patristic Geography had thrown in the way of maritime
adventure were thus finally removed, but Patristic Ethnology led to a
fearful tragedy. With a critical innocence that seems to have overlooked
physical impossibilities and social difficulties, it had been the
practice to refer the peopling of nations to legendary heroes or to the
patriarchs of Scripture. The French were descended from Francus, the son
of Hector; the Britons from Brutus, the son of Æneas; the genealogy of
the Saxon kings could be given up to Adam; but it may excite our mirthful
surprise that the conscientious Spanish chronicles could rise no higher
than to Tubal, the grandson of Noah. The divisions of the Old World,
Asia, Africa, and Europe, were assigned to the three sons of Noah&mdash;Shem,
Ham, and Japheth; and the parentage of those continents was given to
those patriarchs respectively. In this manner all mankind were brought
into a family relationship, all equally the descendants of Adam, equally
participators in his sin and fall. As long as it was supposed that the
lands of Columbus were a part of Asia there was no difficulty; but when
the true position and relations of the American continent were
discovered, that it was separated from  <span class="pag">[166]</span> Asia <a id="by166"></a>by a waste of waters of many
thousand miles, how did the matter stand with the new-comers thus
suddenly obtruded on the scene?
<span class="side"> Denial that the Indians are men.</span>
 The voice of the fathers was altogether
against the possibility of their Adamic descent. St. Augustine had denied
the globular form and the existence of Antipodes; for it was impossible
that there should be people on what was thus vainly asserted to be the
other side of the earth, since none such are mentioned in the Scriptures.
The lust for gold was only too ready to find its justification in the
obvious conclusion; and the Spaniards, with appalling atrocity, proceeded
to act toward these unfortunates as though they did not belong to the
human race. Already their lands and goods had been taken from them by
apostolic authority.
<span class="side">The American tragedy. </span>
Their persons were next seized, under the text that
the heathen are given as an inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the
earth for a possession. It was one unspeakable outrage, one unutterable
ruin, with out discrimination of age or sex. Those who died not under the
lash in a tropical sun died in the darkness of the mine. From sequestered
sand-banks, where the red flamingo fishes in the grey of the morning;
from fever-stricken mangrove thickets, and the gloom of impenetrable
forests; from hiding-places in the clefts of rocks, and the solitude of
invisible caves; from the eternal snows of the Andes, where there was no
witness but the all-seeing Sun, there went up to God a cry of human
despair. By millions upon millions, whole races and nations were
remorselessly cut off. The Bishop of Chiapa affirms that more than
fifteen millions were exterminated in his time!
<span class="side">The crime of Spain.</span>
 From Mexico and Peru a
civilization that might have instructed Europe was crushed out. Is it for
nothing that Spain has been made a hideous skeleton among living nations,
a warning spectacle to the world? Had not her punishment overtaken her,
men would have surely said, "There is no retribution, there is no God!"
It has been her evil destiny to ruin two civilizations, Oriental and
Occidental, and to be ruined thereby herself. With circumstances of
dreadful barbarity she expelled the Moors, who had become children of her
soil by as long a residence as the Normans have had in England from
William  <span class="pag">[167]</span> the <a id="Conqueror167"></a>Conqueror to our time. In America she destroyed races more
civilized than herself. Expulsion and emigration have deprived her of her
best blood, her great cities have sunk into insignificance, and towns
that once had more than a million of inhabitants can now only show a few
scanty thousands.</p>

<p>The discovery of America agitated Europe to its deepest foundations. All
classes of men were affected. The populace at once went wild with a lust
of gold and a love of adventure. Well might Pomponius Lætus, under
process for his philosophical opinions in Rome, shed tears of joy when
tidings of the great event reached him; well might Leo&nbsp;X., a few years
later, sit up till far in the night reading to his sister and his
cardinals the "Oceanica" of Anghiera.</p>

<hr />


<p><span class="side">Vasco de Gama. African coasting voyages.</span>If Columbus failed in his attempt to reach India by sailing to the west,
Vasco de Gama succeeded by sailing to the south. He doubled the Cape of
Good Hope, and retraced the track of the ships of Pharaoh Necho, which
had accomplished the same undertaking two thousand years previously. The
Portuguese had been for long engaged in an examination of the coast of
Africa under the bull of Martin&nbsp;V., which recognised the possibility of
reaching India by passing round that continent. It is an amusing instance
of making scientific discoveries by contract, that King Alphonso made a
bargain with Ferdinand Gomez, of Lisbon, for the exploration of the
African coast, the stipulation being that he should discover not less
than three hundred miles every year, and that the starting-point should
be Sierra Leone.</p>


<p><span class="side">Papal confines of Spain and Portugal.</span>We have seen that a belief in the immobility of the line of no magnetic
variation had led Pope Alexander&nbsp;VI. to establish a perpetual boundary
between the Spanish and Portuguese possessions and fields of adventure.
That line he considered to be the natural boundary between the eastern
and western hemispheres. An accurate determination of longitude was
therefore a national as well as a nautical question. Columbus had relied
on astronomical methods; Gilbert at a  <span class="pag">[168]</span> subsequent <a id="period168"></a>period proposed to
determine it by magnetical observations. The variation itself could not
be accounted for on the doctrine vulgarly received, that magnetism is an
effluvium issuing forth from the root of the tail of the Little Bear, but
was scientifically, though erroneously, explained by Gilbert's hypothesis
that earthy substance is attractive&mdash;that a needle approaching a
continent will incline toward it; and hence that in the midst of the
Atlantic, being equally disturbed by Europe and America, it will point
evenly between both.</p>


<p><span class="side">News that Africa might be doubled.</span>Pedro de Covilho had sent word to King John&nbsp;II., from Cairo, by two Jews,
Rabbi Abraham and Rabbi Joseph, that there was a south cape of Africa
which could be doubled. They brought with them an Arabic map of the
African coast. This was about the time that Bartholomew Diaz had reached
the Cape in two little pinnaces of fifty tons apiece. He sailed August,
1486, and returned December, 1487, with an account of his discovery.
Covilho had learned from the Arabian mariners, who were perfectly
familiar with the east coast, that they had frequently been at the south
of Africa, and that there was no difficulty in passing round the
continent that way.</p>


<p><span class="side">De Gama's successful voyage.</span>A voyage to the south is even more full of portents than one to the west.
The accustomed heavens seem to sink away, and new stars are nightly
approached. Vasco de Gama set sail July 9, 1497, with three ships and 160
men, having with him the Arab map. King John had employed his Jewish
physicians, Roderigo and Joseph, to devise what help they could from the
stars. They applied the astrolabe to marine use, and constructed tables.
These were the same doctors who had told him that Columbus would
certainly succeed in reaching India, and advised him to send out a secret
expedition in anticipation, which was actually done, though it failed
through want of resolution in its captain. Encountering the usual
difficulties, tempestuous weather, and a mutinous crew, who conspired to
put him to death, De Gama succeeded, November 20, in doubling the Cape.
On March 1st he met seven small Arab vessels, and was surprised to find
that they used the compass, quadrants, sea-charts,  <span class="pag">[169]</span> and "had <a id="divers169"></a>divers
maritime mysteries not short of the Portugals."
<span class="side">He reaches India.</span>
With joy he soon after
recovered sight of the northern stars, so long unseen. He now bore away
to the north-east, and on May 19, 1498, reached Calicut, on the Malabar
coast.</p>


<p><span class="side">A commercial revolution the result.</span>The consequences of this voyage were to the last degree important. The
commercial arrangements of Europe were completely dislocated; Venice was
deprived of her mercantile supremacy; the hatred of Genoa was gratified;
prosperity left the Italian towns; Egypt, hitherto supposed to possess a
pre-eminent advantage as offering the best avenue to India, suddenly lost
her position; the commercial monopolies so long in the hands of the
European Jews were broken down. The discovery of America and passage of
the Cape were the first steps of that prodigious maritime development
soon exhibited by Western Europe. And since commercial prosperity is
forthwith followed by the production of men and concentration of wealth,
and moreover implies an energetic intellectual condition, it appeared
before long that the three centres of population, of wealth, of intellect
were shifting westwardly. The front of Europe was suddenly changed; the
British islands, hitherto in a sequestered and eccentric position, were
all at once put in the van of the new movement.</p>

<hr />


<p><span class="side">Ferdinand Magellan enters the Spanish service. </span>Commercial rivalry had thus passed from Venice and Genoa to Spain and
Portugal. The circumnavigation of the earth originated in a dispute
between these kingdoms respecting the Molucca Islands, from which
nutmegs, cloves, and mace were obtained. Ferdinand Magellan had been in
the service of the King of Portugal; but an application he had made for
an increase of half a ducat a month in his stipend having been refused,
he passed into the service of the King of Spain along with one Ruy
Falero, a friend of his, who, among the vulgar, bore the reputation of a
conjurer or magician, but who really possessed considerable astronomical
attainments, devoting himself to the discovery of improved means for
finding the place of a ship at sea. Magellan persuaded the Spanish
government that the Spice Islands  <span class="pag">[170]</span> could <a id="be170"></a>be reached by sailing to the
west, the Portuguese having previously reached them by sailing to the
east, and, if this were accomplished, Spain would have as good a title to
them, under the bull of Alexander&nbsp;VI., as Portugal.
<span class="side">His great voyage commenced. </span>
Five ships, carrying
237 men, were accordingly equipped, and on August 10, 1519, Magellan
sailed from Seville. The Trinitie was the admiral's ship, but the San
Vittoria was destined for immortality. He struck boldly for the
south-west, not crossing the trough of the Atlantic as Columbus had done,
but passing down the length of it, his aim being to find some cleft or
passage in the American Continent through which he might sail into the
Great South Sea. For seventy days he was becalmed under the line. He then
lost sight of the north star, but courageously held on toward the "pole
antartike." He nearly foundered in a storm, "which did not abate till the
three fires called St. Helen, St. Nicholas, and St. Clare appeared
playing in the rigging of the ships." In a new land, to which he gave the
name of Patagoni, he found giants "of good corporature" clad in skins;
one of them, a very pleasant and tractable giant, was terrified at his
own visage in a looking-glass.
<span class="side">He penetrates the American continent.</span>
Among the sailors, alarmed at the distance
they had come, mutiny broke out, requiring the most unflinching
resolution in the commander for its suppression. In spite of his
watchfulness, one ship deserted him and stole back to Spain.
 His perseverance and resolution were at last rewarded by the discovery of the
strait named by him San Vittoria, in affectionate honour of his ship, but
which, with a worthy sentiment, other sailors soon changed to "the Strait
of Magellan."
<span class="side">Reaches the Pacific Ocean.</span>
On November 28, 1520, after a year and a quarter of
struggling, he issued forth from its western portals and entered the
Great South Sea, shedding tears of joy, as Pigafetti, an eye-witness,
relates, when he recognized its infinite expanse&mdash;tears of stern joy that
it had pleased God to bring him at length where he might grapple with its
unknown dangers. Admiring its illimitable but placid surface, and
exulting in the meditation of its secret perils soon to be tried, he
courteously imposed on it the name <span class="pag">[171]</span> it <a id="is171"></a>is for ever to bear, "the Pacific
Ocean." While baffling for an entry into it, he observed with surprise
that in the month of October the nights are only four hours long, and
"considered, in this his navigation, that the pole antartike hath no
notable star like the pole artike, but that there be two clouds of little
stars somewhat dark in the middest, also a cross of fine clear stars, but
that here the needle becomes so sluggish that it needs must be moved with
a bit of loadstone before it will rightly point."</p>


<p><span class="side">The Pacific Ocean crossed.</span>And now the great sailor, having burst through the barrier of the
American continent, steered for the north-west, attempting to regain the
equator. For three months and twenty days he sailed on the Pacific, and
never saw inhabited land. He was compelled by famine to strip off the
pieces of skin and leather wherewith his rigging was here and there
bound, to soak them in the sea and then soften them with warm water, so
as to make a wretched food; to eat the sweepings of the ship and other
loathsome matter; to drink water that had become putrid by keeping; and
yet he resolutely held on his course, though his men were dying daily. As
is quaintly observed, "their gums grew over their teeth, and so they
could not eat." He estimated that he sailed over this unfathomable sea
not less than 12,000 miles.</p>

<p>In the whole history of human undertakings there is nothing that exceeds,
if indeed there is anything that equals, this voyage of Magellan's. That
of Columbus dwindles away in comparison. It is a display of superhuman
courage, superhuman perseverance&mdash;a display of resolution not to be
diverted from its purpose by any motive or any suffering, but inflexibly
persisting to its end. Well might his despairing sailors come to the
conclusion that they had entered on a trackless waste of waters, endless
before them and hopeless in a return. "But, though the Church hath
evermore from Holy Writ affirmed that the earth should be a wide-spread
plain bordered by the waters, yet he comforted himself when he considered
that in the eclipses of the moon the shadow cast of the earth is round;
and as is the shadow, such, in like manner, is the substance." It was a
stout heart&mdash;a heart of <span class="pag">[172]</span> triple <a id="brass172"></a>brass&mdash;which could thus, against such
authority, extract unyielding faith from a shadow.</p>


<p><span class="side">Succeeds in his attempt, and dies.</span>This unparalleled resolution met its reward at last. Magellan reached a
group of islands north of the equator&mdash;the Ladrones. In a few days more
he became aware that his labours had been successful; he met with
adventurers from Sumatra. But, though he had thus grandly accomplished
his object, it was not given to him to complete the circumnavigation of
the globe. At an island called Zebu, or Mutan, he was killed, either, as
has been variously related, in a mutiny of his men, or as they
declared&mdash;in a conflict with the savages, or insidiously by poison. "The
general," they said, "was a very brave man, and received his death wound
in his front; nor would the savages yield up his body for any ransom."
Through treason and revenge it is not unlikely that he fell, for he was a
stern man; no one but a very stern man could have accomplished so daring
a deed. Hardly was he gone when his crew learned that they were actually
in the vicinity of the Moluccas, and that the object of their voyage was
accomplished. On the morning of November 8, 1521, having been at sea two
years and three months, as the sun was rising they entered Tidore, the
chief port of the Spice Islands. The King of Tidore swore upon the Koran
alliance to the King of Spain.</p>


<p><span class="side">Circumnavigation of the earth.</span>I need not allude to the wonderful objects&mdash;destined soon to become
common to voyagers in the Indian Archipelago&mdash;that greeted their eyes:
elephants in trappings; vases, and vessels of porcelain; birds of
Paradise, "that fly not, but be blown by the wind;" exhaustless stores of
the coveted spices, nutmegs, mace, cloves. And now they prepared to bring
the news of their success back to Spain. Magellan's lieutenant, Sebastian
d'Elcano, directed his course for the Cape of Good Hope, again
encountering the most fearful hardships. Out of his slender crew he lost
twenty-one men. He doubled the Cape at last; and on September 7, 1522, in
the port of St. Lucar, near Seville, under his orders, the good ship San
Vittoria came safely to an anchor. She had accomplished the greatest <span class="pag">[173]</span>
achievement <a id="in173"></a>in the history of the human race. She had circumnavigated
the earth.</p>


<p><span class="side">Elcano, the lieutenant of Magellan.</span>Magellan thus lost his life in his enterprise, and yet he made an
enviable exchange. Doubly immortal, and thrice happy! for he impressed
his name indelibly on the earth and the sky, on the strait that connects
the two great oceans, and on those clouds of starry worlds seen in the
southern heavens. He also imposed a designation on the largest portion of
the surface of the globe. His lieutenant, Sebastian d'Elcano, received
such honours as kings can give. Of all armorial bearings ever granted for
the accomplishment of a great and daring deed, his were the proudest and
noblest&mdash;the globe of the earth belted with the inscription, "Primus
circumdedisti me!"</p>


<p><span class="side">Results of the circumnavigation.</span>If the circumnavigation of the earth by Magellan did not lead to such
splendid material results as the discovery of America and the doubling of
the Cape, its moral effects were far more important. Columbus had been
opposed in obtaining means for his expedition because it was suspected to
be of an irreligious nature. Unfortunately, the Church, satisfying
instincts impressed upon her as far back as the time of Constantine, had
asserted herself to be the final arbitress in all philosophical
questions, and especially in this of the figure of the earth had
committed herself against its being globular. Infallibility can never
correct itself&mdash;indeed, it can never be wrong. Rome never retracts
anything; and, no matter what the consequences, never recedes. It was
thus that a theological dogma&mdash;infallibility&mdash;came to be mixed up with a
geographical problem, and that problem liable at any moment to receive a
decisive solution. So long as it rested in a speculative position, or
could be hedged round with mystification, the real state of the case
might be concealed from all except the more intelligent class of men; but
after the circumnavigation had actually been accomplished, and was known
to every one, there was, of course, nothing more to be said. It had now
become altogether useless to bring forward the authority of Lactantius,
of St. Augustine, or of other fathers, that the globular form is impious
and heretical. Henceforth the fact was strong enough to <span class="pag">[174]</span> overpower <a id="all174"></a>all
authority, an exercise of which could have no other result than to injure
itself. It remained only to permit the dispute to pass into oblivion; but
even this could not occur without those who were observant being
impressed with the fact that physical science was beginning to display a
fearful advantage over Patristicism, and presenting unmistakable tokens
that ere long she would destroy her ancient antagonist.</p>


<p><span class="side">Minor voyages and travels.</span>In the midst of these immortal works it is hardly worth while to speak of
minor things. Two centuries had wrought a mighty change in the
geographical ideas of Western Europe. The travels of Marco Polo, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1295, had first given some glimmering of the remote East, the interest in
which was doubtless enhanced by the irruption of the Moguls. Sir John
Mandeville had spent many years in the interior of Asia before the middle
of the next century. Conti had travelled in Persia and India, between
1419 and 1444. Cadamosto, a Venetian, in 1455 had explored the west coast
of Africa. Sebastian Cabot had re-discovered Newfoundland, and,
persisting in the attempt to find a north-west passage to China, had
forced his way into the ice to 67° 30' N. By 1525 the American coast-line
had been determined from Terra del Fuego to Labrador. New Guinea and part
of Australia, had been discovered. The fleet of Cabral, attempting to
double the Cape of Good Hope in 1500, was driven to Brazil. A ship was
sent back to Portugal with the news. Hence, had not Columbus sailed when
he did, the discovery of America could not have been long postponed.
Balboa saw the Great South Sea September 25th, 1513. Wading up to his
knees in the water, with his sword in one hand and the Spanish flag in
the other, he claimed that vast ocean for Castile. Nothing could now
prevent the geography of the earth from being completed.</p>


<p><span class="side">Participation of other nations in these events.</span>I cannot close these descriptions of maritime adventure without observing
that they are given from the European point of view. The Western nations
have complacently supposed that whatever was unknown to them was
therefore altogether unknown. We have seen that the Arabs were
practically <span class="pag">[175]</span> and <a id="perfectly175"></a>perfectly familiar with the fact that Africa might be
circumnavigated; the East Indian geography was thoroughly understood by
the Buddhist priesthood, who had, on an extensive scale, carried forward
their propagandism for twenty-five hundred years in those regions. But
doubtless the most perfect geographical knowledge existed among the Jews,
those cosmopolite traders who conducted mercantile transactions from the
Azores to the interior of China, from the Baltic to the coast of
Mozambique. It was actually through them that the existence of the Cape
of Good Hope was first made known in Europe. Five hundred years before
Columbus, the Scandinavian adventurers had discovered America, but so low
was the state of intelligence in Europe that the very memory of these
voyages had been altogether lost. The circumnavigation of the earth is,
however, strictly the achievement of the West. I have been led to make
the remarks in this paragraph, since they apply again on another
occasion&mdash;the introduction of what is called the Baconian philosophy, the
principles of which were not only understood, but carried into practice
in the East eighteen hundred years before Bacon was born.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is scarcely necessary that I should offer any excuse for devoting a
few pages to a digression on the state of affairs in Mexico and Peru.
Nothing illustrates more strikingly the doctrine which it is the object
of this book to teach.</p>


<p><span class="side">Progress of man in the New World the same as in the Old.</span>The social condition of America at its discovery demonstrates that
similar ideas and similar usages make their appearance spontaneously in
the progress of civilization of different countries, showing how little
they depend on accident, how closely they are connected with the
organization, and, therefore, with the necessities of man. From important
ideas and great institutions down to the most trifling incidents of
domestic life, so striking is the parallel between the American
aborigines and Europeans that with difficulty do we divest ourselves of
the impression that there must have been some intercommunication. Each
was, however, pursuing an isolated and spontaneous progress; and yet how
closely does the picture of life <span class="pag">[176]</span> in <a id="the176"></a>the New World answer to that in the
Old.
<span class="side">Mexico, its political system.</span>
The monarch of Mexico lived in barbaric pomp, wore a golden crown
resplendent with gems; was aided in his duties by a privy council; the
great lords held their lands of him by the obligation of military
service. In him resided the legislative power, yet he was subject to the
laws of the realm. The judges held their office independently of him, and
were not liable to removal by him. The laws were reduced to writing,
which, though only a system of hieroglyphics, served its purpose so well
that the Spaniards were obliged to admit its validity in their courts,
and to found a professorship for perpetuating a knowledge of it. Marriage
was regarded as an important social engagement. Divorces were granted
with difficulty. Slavery was recognized in the case of prisoners of war,
debtors, and criminals, but no man could be born a slave in Mexico. No
distinction of castes was permitted. The government mandates and public
intelligence were transmitted by a well-organized postal service of
couriers able to make two hundred miles a day. The profession of arms was
the recognized avocation of the nobility; the military establishments,
whether in active service in the field, or as garrisons in large towns,
being supported by taxation on produce or manufactures. The armies were
divided into corps of 10,000, and these again into regiments of 400.
Standards and banners were used; the troops executed their evolutions to
military music, and were provided with hospitals, army surgeons, and a
medical staff. In the human hives of Europe, Asia, and America, the bees
were marshalled in the same way, and were instinctively building their
combs alike.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its religion, priesthood, and ceremonies. </span>The religious state is a reflexion of that of Europe and Asia. The
worship was an imposing ceremonial. The common people had a mythology of
many gods, but the higher classes were strictly Unitarian, acknowledging
one almighty, invisible Creator. Of the popular deities, the god of war
was the chief. He was born of a virgin, and conceived by mysterious
conception of a ball of bright-coloured feathers floating on the air. The
priests administered a rite of baptism to infants for the purpose of
washing away <span class="pag">[177]</span> their <a id="sins177"></a>sins, and taught that there are rewards and
punishments in a life to come&mdash;a paradise for the good, a hell of
darkness for the wicked. The hierarchy descended by due degrees from the
chief priests, who were almost equal to the sovereign in authority, down
to the humble ecclesiastical servitors. Marriage was permitted to the
clergy. They had monastic institutions, the inmates praying thrice a day
and once at night. They practised ablutions, vigils, penance by
flagellation or pricking with aloe thorns. They compelled the people to
auricular confession, required of them penance, gave absolution. Their
ecclesiastical system had reached a strength which was never attained in
Europe, since absolution by the priest for civil offences was an
acquittal in the eye of the law. It was the received doctrine that men do
not sin of their own free will, but because they are impelled thereto by
planetary influences. With sedulous zeal, the clergy engrossed the duty
of public education, thereby keeping society in their grasp.
<span class="side">Its literary condition.</span>
 Their writing was on cotton cloth or skins, or on papyrus made of the aloe. At
the conquest immense collections of this kind of literature were in
existence, but the first Archbishop of Mexico burnt, as was affirmed, a
mountain of such manuscripts in the marketplace, stigmatizing them as
magic scrolls. About the same time, and under similar circumstances,
Cardinal Ximenes burnt a vast number of Arabic manuscripts in Granada.</p>


<p><span class="side">Divisions of time: the week, month, year.</span>The condition of astronomy in Mexico is illustrated as it is in Egypt by
the calendar. The year was of eighteen months, each month of twenty days,
five complementary ones being added to make up the three hundred and
sixty-five. The month had four weeks, the week five days; the last day,
instead of being for religious purposes, was market day. To provide for
the six additional hours of the year, they intercalated twelve and a half
days every fifty-two years. At the conquest the Mexican calendar was in a
better condition than the Spanish. As in some other countries, the clergy
had for ecclesiastical purposes a lunar division of time. The day had
sixteen hours, commencing at sunrise. They had sun-dials for determining
the hour, and also instruments for the solstices and equinoxes. <span class="pag">[178]</span> They <a id="had178"></a>had
ascertained the globular form of the earth and the obliquity of the
ecliptic. The close of the fifty-second year was celebrated with grand
religious ceremonials; all the fires were suffered to go out, and new
ones kindled by the friction of sticks.
<span class="side">Private life, mechanical arts, trade. </span>
 Their agriculture was superior to
that of Europe; there was nothing in the Old World to compare with the
menageries and botanical gardens of Huaxtepec, Chapultepec, Istapalapan,
and Tezcuco. They practised with no inconsiderable skill the more
delicate mechanical arts, such as those of the jeweller and enameller.
From the aloe they obtained pins and needles, thread, cord, paper, food,
and an intoxicating drink. They made earthenware, knew how to lacquer
wood, employed cochineal as a scarlet dye. They were skilful weavers of
fine cloth, and excelled in the production of feather-work, their
gorgeous humming-birds furnishing material for that purpose. In
metallurgy they were behind the Old World, not having the use of iron;
but, as the Old World had formerly done, they employed bronze in its
stead. They knew how to move immense masses of rock; their great calendar
stone, of porphyry, weighed more than fifty tons, and was brought a
distance of many miles. Their trade was carried on, not in shops, but by
markets or fairs held on the fifth day. They employed a currency of gold
dust, pieces of tin, and bags of cacao.
<span class="side">Luxury of the higher classes.</span>
 In their domestic economy, though
polygamy was permitted, it was in practice confined to the wealthy. The
women did not work abroad, but occupied themselves in spinning,
embroidering, feather-work, music. Ablution was resorted to both before
and after meals; perfumes were used at the toilet. The Mexicans gave to
Europe tobacco, snuff, the turkey, chocolate, cochineal. Like us, they
had in their entertainments solid dishes, with suitable condiments,
gravies, sauces, and desserts of pastries, confections, fruits, both
fresh and preserved. They had chafing-dishes of silver or gold. Like us,
they knew the use of intoxicating drinks; like us, they not unfrequently
took them to excess; like us, they heightened their festivities with
dancing and music. They had theatrical and pantomimic shows. At Tezcuco
there was a council of <span class="pag">[179]</span> music, <a id="which179"></a>which, moreover, exercised a censorship on
philosophical works, as those of astronomy and history. In that city
North American civilization reached its height. The king's palace was a
wonderful work of art. It was said that 200,000 men were employed in its
construction. Its harem was adorned with magnificent tapestries of
featherwork; in its garden were fountains, cascades, baths, statues,
alabasters, cedar groves, forests, and a wilderness of flowers. In
conspicuous retirement in one part of the city was a temple, with a dome
of polished black marble, studded with stars of gold, in imitation of the
sky. It was dedicated to the omnipotent, invisible God. In this no
sacrifices were offered, but only sweet-scented flowers and gums.
<span class="side">Their monotheism and philosophical sentiments.</span>
The prevailing religious feeling is expressed by the sentiments of one of the
kings, many of whom had prided themselves in their poetical skill: "Let
us," he says, "aspire to that heaven where all is eternal, and where
corruption never comes." He taught his children not to confide in idols,
but only to conform to the outward worship of them in deference to public
opinion.</p>


<p><span class="side">Peru&mdash;unknown to Mexico.</span>To the preceding description of the social condition of Mexico I shall
add a similar brief account of that of Peru, for the conclusions to be
drawn from a comparison of the spontaneous process of civilization in
these two countries with the process in Europe is of importance to the
attainment of a just idea of the development of mankind. The most
competent authorities declare that the Mexicans and Peruvians were
ignorant of each other's existence.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its geographical peculiarities.</span>In one particular especially is the position of Peru interesting. It
presents an analogy to Upper Egypt, that cradle of the civilization of
the Old World, in this, that its sandy coast is a rainless district. This
sandy-coast region is about sixty miles in width, hemmed in on the east
by grand mountain ranges, which diminish in size on approaching the
Isthmus of Panama; the entire length of the Peruvian empire having been
nearly 2,400 miles, it reached from the north of the equator to what is
now known as Chili. In breadth it varied at different points.
<span class="side">A rainless country like Egypt.</span>
 The east wind, which <span class="pag">[180]</span> has <a id="crossed180"></a>crossed the Atlantic, and is therefore charged with
humidity, being forced by the elevation of the South American continent,
and especially by the range of the Andes, upward, is compelled to
surrender most of its moisture, which finds its way back to the Atlantic
in those prodigious rivers that make the country east of the Andes the
best watered region of the world; but as soon as that wind has crossed
the mountain ridge and descends on the western slope, it becomes a dry
and rainless wind, and hence the district intervening to the Pacific has
but a few insignificant streams.
<span class="side">Its system of agriculture.</span>
The sides of this great mountain range
might seem altogether unadapted to the pursuit of agriculture, but the
state of Peruvian civilization is at once demonstrated when it is said
that these mountain slopes had become a garden, immense terraces having
been constructed wherever required, and irrigation on a grander scale
than that of Egypt carried on by gigantic canals and aqueducts. Advantage
was taken of the different mean annual temperatures at different
altitudes to pursue the cultivation of various products, for difference
in height topographically answers to difference in latitude
geographically, and thus, in a narrow space, the Peruvians had every
variety of temperature, from that corresponding to the hottest portions
of Southern Europe to that of Lapland. In the mountains of Peru, as has
been graphically said, man sees "all the stars of the heavens and all the
families of plants." On plateaus at a great elevation above the sea there
were villages and even cities. Thus the plain upon which Quito stands,
under the equator, is nearly ten thousand feet high. So great was their
industry that the Peruvians had gardens and orchards above the clouds,
and on ranges still higher flocks of lamas, in regions bordering on the
limit of perpetual snow.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its great roads and engineering,</span>Through the entire length of the empire two great military roads were
built, one on the plateau, the other on the shore. The former, for nearly
two thousand miles, crossed sierras covered with snow, was thrown over
ravines, or went through tunnels in the rocks; it scaled the more
difficult precipices by means of stairways. Where it was possible, it was
carried over <span class="pag">[181]</span> the <a id="mountain181"></a>mountain clefts by filling them with masonry, or, where
that could not be done, suspension bridges were used, the cables being
made of osiers or maguey fibres. Some of these cables are said to have
been as thick as a man, and two hundred feet long. Where such bridges
could not be thrown across, and a stream flowed in the bottom of the
mountain valley, the passage was made by ferry-boats or rafts. As to the
road itself, it was about twenty feet in width, faced with flags covered
with bitumen, and had mile-stones. Our admiration at this splendid
engineering is enhanced when we remember that it was accomplished without
iron and gunpowder. The shore road was built on an embankment, with a
clay parapet on each side, and shade trees. Where circumstances called
for it, piles were used.
<span class="side"> and expresses by couriers.</span>
Every five miles there was a post-house. The
public couriers, as in Mexico, could make, if necessary, two hundred
miles a day. Of these roads Humboldt says that they were among the most
useful and most stupendous executed by the hand of man. The reader need
scarcely be told that there were no such triumphs of skill in Spain. From
the circumstance that there were no swift animals, as the horse or
dromedary, the width of these roads was sufficient, since they were
necessarily used for foot passage alone.</p>


<p><span class="side">Cuzco&mdash;the military centre.</span>In Cuzco, the metropolis, was the imperial residence of the Inca and the
Temple of the Sun. It contained edifices which excited the amazement of
the Spanish adventurers themselves&mdash;streets, squares, bridges, fortresses
surrounded by turreted walls, subterranean galleries by which the
garrison could reach important parts of the town. Indeed, the great roads
we have spoken of might be regarded as portions of an immense system of
military works spread all over the country, and having their centre at
Cuzco.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Inca&mdash;the Lord of the Empire.</span>The imperial dignity was hereditary, descending from father to son. As in
Egypt, the monarch not unfrequently had his sisters for wives. His diadem
consisted of a scarlet tasseled fringe round his brow, adorned with two
feathers. He wore earrings of great weight. His dress of lama-wool was
dyed scarlet, inwoven with gold and studded with gems.  <span class="pag">[182]</span>  <a id="Whoever182"></a>Whoever
approached him bore a light burden on the shoulder as a badge of
servitude, and was barefoot. The Inca was not only the representative of
the temporal, but also of the spiritual power. He was more than supreme
pontiff, for he was a descendant of the Sun, the god of the nation. He
made laws, imposed taxes, raised armies, appointed or removed judges at
his pleasure. He travelled in a sedan ornamented with gold and emeralds;
the roads were swept before him, strewn with flowers, and perfumed.
<span class="side">The national palace.</span>
His palace at Yucay was described by the Spaniards as a fairy scene. It was
filled with works of Indian art; images of animals and plants decorated
the niches of its walls; it had an endless labyrinth of gorgeous
chambers, and here and there shady crypts for quiet retirement. Its baths
were great golden bowls. It was embosomed in artificial forests. The
imperial ladies and concubines spent their time in beautifully furnished
chambers, or in gardens, with cascades and fountains, grottoes and
bowers. It was in what few countries can boast of, a temperate region in
the torrid zone.</p>


<p><span class="side">Religion of Peru, its establishments and ceremonial.</span>The Peruvian religion ostensibly consisted of a worship of the Sun, but
the higher classes had already become emancipated from such a material
association, and recognized the existence of one almighty, invisible God.
They expected the resurrection of the body and the continuance of the
soul in a future life. It was their belief that in the world to come our
occupations will resemble those we have followed here. Like the
Egyptians, who had arrived at similar ideas, the Peruvians practised
embalming, the mummies of their Incas being placed in the Temple of the
Sun at Cuzco, the kings on the right, the queens on the left, clad in
their robes of state, and with their hands crossed on their bosoms,
seated in golden chairs, waiting for the day when the soul will return to
reanimate the body. The mummies of distinguished personages were buried
in a sitting posture under tumuli of earth. To the Supreme Being but one
temple was dedicated. It was in a sacred valley, to which pilgrimages
were made. In the Peruvian mythology, heaven was above the sky, hell in
the interior of the earth&mdash;it was the realm of an evil spirit called
<span class="pag">[183]</span> Cupay. <a id="The183"></a>The general resemblance of these to Egyptian doctrines may
forcibly impress upon us that they are ideas with which the human mind
necessarily occupies itself in its process of intellectual development.
As in all other countries, the educated classes were greatly in advance
of the common people, who were only just emerging from fetichism, and
engrossed in the follies of idolatry and man-worship. Nevertheless, the
government found it expedient to countenance the vulgar delusion; indeed,
the political system was actually founded upon it. But the Peruvians were
in advance of the Europeans in this respect, that they practised no
persecutions upon those who had become mentally emancipated. Besides the
sun, the visible god, other celestial bodies were worshipped in a
subordinate way. It was supposed that there were spirits in the wind,
lightning, thunder; genii in the mountains, rivers, springs, and
grottoes. In the great Temple of the Sun at Cuzco an image of that deity
was placed so as to receive the rays of the luminary at his rising; a
like artifice had been practised in the Serapion at Alexandria. There was
also a sanctuary dedicated to the Sun in the island of Titicaca, and, it
is said, between three and four hundred temples of a subordinate kind in
Cuzco. To the great temple were attached not fewer than four thousand
priests and fifteen hundred vestal virgins, the latter being intrusted
with the care of the sacred fire, and from them the most beautiful were
chosen to pass into the Inca's seraglio. The popular faith had a ritual
and a splendid ceremonial, the great national festival being at the
summer solstice. The rays of the sun were then collected by a concave
mirror, and fire rekindled thereby, or by the friction of wood.</p>


<p><span class="side">Social system&mdash;the nobility, the people. </span>As to their social system, polygamy was permitted, but practically it was
confined to the higher classes. Social subordination was thoroughly
understood. The Inca Tupac Yupanqui says, "Knowledge was never intended
for the people, but only for those of generous blood." The nobility were
of two orders, the polygamic descendants of the Incas, who were the main
support of the state, and the adopted nobles of nations that have been
conquered. As to the people, nowhere else in the whole world was such an
<span class="pag">[184]</span> extraordinary <a id="policy184"></a>policy of supervision practised. They were divided into
groups of ten, fifty, one hundred, five hundred, one thousand, ten
thousand, and over the last an Inca noble was placed. Through this system
a rigid centralization was insured, the Inca being the pivot upon which
all the national affairs turned, it was an absolutism worthy of the
admiration of many existing European nations.
<span class="side">Organization of Labour.</span>
The entire territory was
divided into three parts; one belonged to the Sun, one to the Inca, one
to the people. As a matter of form, the subdivision was annually made; in
practice, however, as perhaps must always be the result of such
agrarianism, the allotments were continually renewed. All the land was
cultivated by the people, and in the following order: first, that of the
Sun, then that of the destitute and infirm, then that of the people, and,
lastly, that of the Inca. The Sun and the Inca owned all the sheep, which
were sheared and their wool distributed to the people, or cotton
furnished in its stead. The Inca's officers saw that it was all woven,
and that no one was idle. An annual survey of the country, its farming
and mineral products, was made, the inventory being transmitted to the
government. A register was kept of births and deaths; periodically a
general census was taken. The Inca, at once emperor and pope, was
enabled, in that double capacity, to exert a rigorous patriarchal rule
over his people, who were treated like mere children&mdash;not suffered to be
oppressed, but compelled to be occupied; for, with a worldly wisdom which
no other nation presents, labour was here acknowledged not only as a
means, but also as an end. In Peru a man could not improve his social
state; by these refinements of legislation he was brought into an
absolutely stationary condition. He could become neither richer nor
poorer; but it was the boast of the system that every one lived exempt
from social suffering&mdash;that all enjoyed competence.</p>


<p><span class="side">Military system; warlike resources.</span>The army consisted of 200,000 men. Their weapons were bows, lances,
slings, battle-axes, swords; their means of defence, shields, bucklers,
helmets, and coats of quilted cotton. Each regiment had its own banner,
but the imperial standard, the national emblem, was a rainbow, the
offspring of the <span class="pag">[185]</span> Sun. <a id="The185"></a>The swords and many of the domestic implements
were of bronze; the arrows were tipped with quartz or bone, or points of
gold and silver. A strict discipline was maintained on marching,
granaries and depôts being established at suitable distances on the
roads. With a policy inflexibly persisted in, the gods of conquered
countries were transported to Cuzco, and the vanquished compelled to
worship the Sun; their children were obliged to learn the Peruvian
language, the government providing them teachers for that purpose. As an
incitement, this knowledge was absolutely required as a condition for
public office. To amalgamate the conquered districts thoroughly, their
inhabitants were taken away by ten thousand, transported to distant parts
of the empire, not, as in the Old World, to be worked to death as slaves,
but to be made into Peruvians; an equal number of natives were sent in
their stead, to whom, as a recompense for their removal, extraordinary
privileges were given. It was the immemorial policy of the empire to
maintain profound tranquillity in the interior and perpetual war on the
frontiers.</p>


<p>The philosophical advancement of the Peruvians was much retarded by their
imperfect method of writing&mdash;a method greatly inferior to that of Egypt.
<span class="side">Peruvian literature&mdash;the quipus.</span>A cord of coloured threads, called quipus, was only indifferently suited
to the purposes of enumeration, and by no means equal to hieroglyphics as
a method of expressing general facts. But it was their only system.
Notwithstanding this drawback, they had a literature consisting of
poetry, dramatic compositions, and the like. Their scientific attainments
were inferior to the Mexican. Their year was divided into months, their
months into weeks. They had gnomons to indicate the solstices. One, in
the form of an obelisk, in the centre of a circle, on which was marked an
east and west line, indicated the equinox. These gnomons were destroyed
by the Spaniards in the belief that they were for idolatrous purposes,
for on the national festivals it was customary to decorate them with
leaves and flowers. As the national religion consisted in the worship of
the Sun, it was not without reason that Quito was regarded as a holy
place, from its position upon the equator.</p>


<p><span class="side">Agriculture carried to perfection.</span>  <span class="pag">[186]</span> <a id="In186"></a>In their extraordinary provisions for agriculture, the national pursuit,
the skill of the Peruvians is well seen. A rapid elevation from the
sea-level to the heights of the mountains gave them, in a small compass,
every variety of climate, and they availed themselves of it. They
terraced the mountain sides, filling the terraces with rich earth. They
excavated pits in the sand, surrounded them with adobe walls, and filled
them with manured soil. On the low level they cultivated bananas and
cassava; on the terraces above, maize and quinoa; still higher, tobacco;
and above that the potato. From a comparatively limited surface, they
raised great crops by judiciously using manures, employing for that
purpose fish, and especially guano. Their example has led to the use of
the latter substance for a like purpose in our own times in Europe. The
whole civilized world has followed them in the cultivation of the potato.
The Peruvian bark is one of the most invaluable remedies. Large tracts of
North America would be almost uninhabitable without the use of its active
alkaloid quinine, which actually, in no insignificant manner, reduces the
percentage mortality throughout the United States.</p>


<p><span class="side">The great aqueduct of Condesuya.</span>Indispensably necessary to their agricultural system were their great
water-works. In Spain there was nothing worthy of being compared with
them. The aqueduct of Condesuya was nearly 500 miles long. Its engineers
had overcome difficulties in a manner that might well strike modern times
with admiration. Its water was distributed as prescribed by law; there
were officers to see to its proper use. From these great water-works and
from their roads it may be judged that the architectural skill of the
Peruvians was far from insignificant. They constructed edifices of
porphyry, granite, brick; but their buildings were for the most part low,
and suitable to an earthquake country.</p>


<p><span class="side">The stages of human development always the same.</span>
I have dwelt at some length on the domestic history of Mexico and Peru
because it is intimately connected with one of the philosophical
principles which it is the object of this book to teach, viz., that human
progress takes place under an unvarying law, and therefore in a definite
way. The <span class="pag">[187]</span> trivial <a id="incidents187"></a>incidents mentioned in the preceding paragraphs may
perhaps have seemed insignificant or wearisome, but it is their very
commonness, their very familiarity, that gives them, when rightly
considered, a surprising interest. There is nothing in these minute
details but what we find to be perfectly natural from the European point
of view. They might be, for that matter, instead of reminiscences of the
spontaneous evolution of a people shut out from the rest of the world by
impassable oceans, a relation of the progress of some European or Asiatic
nation. The man of America advanced in his course of civilization as did
the man of the Old World, devising the same institutions, guided by the
same intentions, constrained by the same desires. From the great features
of his social system down to the little details of his domestic life,
there is a sameness with what was done in Asia, Africa, Europe. But
similar results imply a similar cause. What, then, is there possessed in
common by the Chinese, the Hindoo, the Egyptian, the European, the
American? Surely not climate, nor equal necessities, nor equal
opportunity. Simply nothing but this&mdash;corporeal organization! As
automatons constructed in the same way will do the same things, so, in
organic forms, sameness of structure will give rise to identity of
function and similarity of acts. The same common sense guides men all
over the world. Common sense is a function of common organization. All
natural history is full of illustrations.
<span class="side">Analogy between societies of men and societies of animals.</span>
It may be offensive to our
pride, but it is none the less true, that in his social progress, the
free-will of which man so boasts himself in his individual capacity
disappears as an active influence, and the domination of general and
inflexible laws becomes manifest. The free-will of the individual is
supplanted by instinct and automatism in the race. To each individual bee
the career is open; he may taste of this flower and avoid that; he may be
industrious in the garden, or idle away his time in the air; but the
history of one hive is the history of another hive; there will be a
predestined organization&mdash;the queen, the drones, the workers. In the
midst of a thousand unforeseen, uncalculated, variable acts, a definite
result, with unerring certainty, emerges; the combs are built in a
pre-ordained way, and filled with honey at last. <span class="pag">[188]</span> From <a id="bees188"></a>bees, and wasps,
and ants, and birds&mdash;from all that low animal life on which he looks with
such supercilious contempt, man is destined one day to learn what in
truth he really is.</p>


<p><span class="side">The crime of Spain in America.</span> For a second reason, also, I have dwelt on these details. The enormous
crime of Spain in destroying this civilization has never yet been
appreciated in Europe. After an attentive consideration of the facts of
the case, I agree in the conclusion of Carli, that at the time of the
conquest the moral man in Peru was superior to the European, and I will
add, the intellectual man also. Was there in Spain, or even in all
Europe, a political system carried out into the practical details of
actual life, and expressed in great public works, as its outward visible
and enduring sign, which could at all compare with that of Peru? Its only
competitor was the Italian system, but that for long had been actively
used to repress the intellectual advancement of man.
<span class="side">The Spaniard and the American.</span>
In vain the
Spaniards excuse their atrocities on the plea that a nation like the
Mexican, which permitted cannibalism, should not be regarded as having
emerged from the barbarous state, and that one which, like Peru,
sacrificed human hecatombs at the funeral solemnities of great men, must
have been savage. Let it be remembered that there is no civilized nation
whose popular practices do not lag behind its intelligence; let it be
remembered that in this respect Spain herself also was guilty. In
America, human sacrifice was part of a religious solemnity, unstained by
passion. The auto da fé of Europe was a dreadful cruelty; not an offering
to heaven, but a gratification of spite, hatred, fear, vengeance&mdash;the
most malignant passions of earth.
<span class="side">European and American human sacrifice.</span>
 There was no spectacle on the American
continent at which a just man might so deeply blush for his race as that
presented in Western Europe when the heretic from whom confession had
been wrung by torture passed to his stake in a sleeveless garment, with
flames of fire and effigies of an abominable import depicted upon it. Let
it be remembered that by the Inquisition, from 1481 to 1808, 340,000
persons had been punished, and of these nearly 32,000 burnt. Let what was
done in the south of France be remembered. Let it be also <span class="pag">[189]</span> remembered
<a id="that189"></a>that, considering the worthlessness of the body of man, and that, at the
best, it is at last food for the worm&mdash;considering the infinite value of
his immortal soul, for the redemption of which the agony and death of the
Son of God were not too great a price to pay&mdash;indignities offered to the
body are less wicked than indignities offered to the soul. It would be
well for him who comes forward as an accuser of Mexico and Peru in their
sin to dispose of the fact that at that period the entire authority of
Europe was directed to the perversion, and even total repression of
thought&mdash;to an enslaving of the mind, and making that noblest creation of
Heaven a worthless machine. To taste of human flesh is less criminal in
the eye of God than to stifle human thought.</p>


<p><span class="side">Antiquity of American civilization.</span>Lastly, there is another point to which I will with brevity allude. It
has been widely asserted that Mexican and Peruvian civilization was
altogether a recent affair, dating at most only two or three centuries
before the conquest. It would be just as well to say that there was no
civilization in India before the time of the Macedonian invasion because
there exist no historic documents in that country anterior to that event.
The Mexicans and Peruvians were not heroes of a romance to whom wonderful
events were of common occurrence, whose lives were regulated by laws not
applying to the rest of the human race, who could produce results in a
day for which elsewhere a thousand years are required. They were men and
women like ourselves, slowly and painfully, and with many failures,
working out their civilization. The summary manner in which they have
been disposed of reminds us of the amusing way in which the popular
chronology deals with the hoary annals of Egypt and China. Putting aside
the imperfect methods of recording events practised by the autochthons of
the Western world, he who estimates rightly the slowness with which man
passes forward in his process of civilization, and collates therewith the
prodigious works of art left by those two nations&mdash;an enduring evidence
of the point to which they had attained&mdash;will find himself constrained to
cast aside such idle assertions as altogether unworthy of confutation, or
even of attention.</p>

<p><span class="side">The rise of criticism.</span> <span class="pag">[190]</span> In estimating the influences of literature on the approach of the Age of
Reason in Europe, the chief incidents to be considered are the disuse of
Latin as a learned language, the formation of modern tongues from the
vulgar dialects, the invention of printing, the decline of the power of
the pulpit, and its displacement by that of the press. These, joined to
the moral and intellectual influences at that time predominating, led to
the great movement known as the Reformation.</p>


<p><span class="side">Epoch of the intellectual movement.</span>As if to mark out to the world the real cause of its intellectual
degradation, the regeneration of Italy commenced with the exile of the
popes to Avignon. During their absence, so rapid was the progress that it
had become altogether impossible to <span class="pag">[191]</span> make <a id="any191"></a>any successful resistance, or
to restore the old condition of things on their return to Rome. The
moment that the leaden cloud which they had kept suspended over the
country was withdrawn, the light from heaven shot in, and the ready
peninsula became instinct with life.</p>


<p><span class="side">Use of Latin as a sacred language.</span>The unity of the Church, and, therefore, its power, required the use of
Latin as a sacred language. Through this Rome had stood in an attitude
strictly European, and was enabled to maintain a general international
relation. It gave her far more power than her asserted celestial
authority, and, much as she claims to have done, she is open to
condemnation that, with such a signal advantage in her hands, never again
to be enjoyed by any successor, she did not accomplish much more. Had not
the sovereign pontiffs been so completely occupied with maintaining their
emoluments and temporalities in Italy, they might have made the whole
Continent advance like one man. Their officials could pass without
difficulty into every nation, and communicate without embarrassment with
each other, from Ireland to Bohemia, from Italy to Scotland. The
possession of a common tongue gave them the administration of
international affairs with intelligent allies everywhere speaking the
same language.</p>


<p><span class="side">Causes of the dislike of Rome to the Greek,</span>Not, therefore, without cause was the hatred manifested by Rome to the
restoration of Greek and introduction of Hebrew, and the alarm with which
she perceived the modern languages forming out of the vulgar dialects.
The prevalence of Latin was the condition of her power, its deterioration
the measure of her decay, its disuse the signal of her limitation to a
little principality in Italy. In fact, the development of European
languages was the instrument of her overthrow. They formed an effectual
communication between the mendicant friars and the illiterate populace,
and there was not one of them that did not display in its earliest
productions a sovereign contempt for her. We have seen how it was with
the poetry of Languedoc.</p>


<p><span class="side"> and danger from modern languages.</span>The rise of the many-tongued European literature was therefore
co-incident with the decline of papal Christianity. European literature
was impossible under <span class="pag">[192]</span> the <a id="Catholic192"></a>Catholic rule. A grand, and solemn, and
imposing religious unity enforced the literary unity which is implied in
the use of a single language. No more can a living thought be embodied in
a dead language than activity be imparted to a corpse.
<span class="side"> Public disadvantages of a sacred tongue.</span>
That principle of
stability which Italy hoped to give to Europe essentially rested on the
compulsory use of a dead tongue. The first token of intellectual
emancipation was the movement of the great Italian poets, led by Dante,
who often, not without irreverence, broke the spell. Unity in religion
implies unity through a sacred language, and hence the non-existence of
particular national literatures.</p>


<p><span class="side">Effect of modern languages.</span>Even after Rome had suffered her great discomfiture on the scientific
question respecting the motion of the earth, the conquering party was not
unwilling to veil its thoughts in the Latin tongue, partly because it
thereby insured a more numerous class of intelligent readers, and partly
because ecclesiastical authority was now disposed to overlook what must
otherwise be treated as offensive, since to write in Latin was obviously
a pledge of abstaining from an appeal to the vulgar. The effect of the
introduction of modern languages was to diminish intercommunication among
the learned.</p>


<p><span class="side">Approach of a crisis in Europe.</span>The movement of human affairs, for so many years silent and
imperceptible, was at length coming to a crisis. An appeal to the
emotions and moral sentiments at the basis of the system, the history of
which has occupied us so long, had been fully made, and found
ineffectual. It was now the time for a like appeal to the understanding.
Each age of life has its own logic. The logic of the senses is in due
season succeeded by that of the intellect. Of faith there are two kinds,
one of acquiescence, one of conviction; and a time inevitably arrives
when emotional faith is supplanted by intellectual.</p>



<p><span class="side">Cosmo de' Medici. Florence.</span>As if to prove that the impending crisis was not the offspring of human
intentions, and not occasioned by any one man, though that man might be
the sovereign pontiff, Nicolas&nbsp;V. found in his patronage of letters and
art a rival and friend in Cosmo de' Medici. An instructive incident shows
how great a <span class="pag">[193]</span> change <a id="had193"></a>had taken place in the sentiments of the higher
classes: Cosmo, the richest of Italians, who had lavished his wealth on
palaces, churches, hospitals, libraries, was comforted on his death-bed,
not, as in former days would have been the case, by ministers of
religion, but by Marsilius Ficinus, the Platonist, who set before him the
arguments for a future life, and consoled his passing spirit with the
examples and precepts of Greek philosophy, teaching him thereby to
exchange faith for hope, forgetting that too often hopes are only the
day-dreams of men, not less unsubstantial and vain than their kindred of
the night. Ficinus had perhaps come to the conviction that philosophy is
only a higher stage of theology, the philosopher a very enlightened
theologian.
<span class="side">Reappearance of Platonism in Italy.</span>
 He was the representative of Platonism, which for so many
centuries had been hidden from the sight of men in Eastern monasteries
since its overthrow in Alexandria, and which was now emerging into
existence in the favouring atmosphere of Italy. His school looked back
with delight, and even with devotion, to the illustrious pagan times,
commemorating by a symposium on November 13th the birthday of Plato. The
Academy of Athens was revived in the Medicean gardens of Florence. Not
that Ficinus is to be regarded as a servile follower of the great
philosopher.
<span class="side">Doctrines of Marsilius Ficinus.</span>
 He alloyed the doctrines of Plato with others derived from a
more sinister source&mdash;the theory of the Mohammedan Averroes, of which it
was an essential condition that there is a soul of humanity, through
their relations with which individual souls are capable of forming
universal ideas, for such, Averroes asserted, is the necessary
consequence of the emanation theory.</p>


<p><span class="side">Revival of Greek learning in Italy.</span>Under such auspices, and at this critical moment, occurred the revival of
Greek literature in Italy. It had been neglected for more than seven
hundred years. In the solitary instances of individuals to whom here and
there a knowledge of that language was imputed, there seem satisfactory
reasons for supposing that their requirements amounted to little more
than the ability of translating some "petty patristic treatise." The
first glimmerings of this revival appear <span class="pag">[194]</span> in <a id="the194"></a>the thirteenth century; they
are somewhat more distinct in the fourteenth. The capture of
Constantinople by the Latin Crusaders had done little more than diffuse a
few manuscripts and works of art along with the more highly prized
monkish relics in the West. It was the Turkish pressure, which all
reflecting Greeks foresaw could have no other result than the fall of the
Byzantine power, that induced some persons of literary tastes to seek a
livelihood and safety in Italy.</p>


<p><span class="side">Gradual progress of the Restoration.</span>In the time of Petrarch, 1304-1374, the improvement did not amount to
much. That illustrious poet says that there were not more than ten
persons in Italy who could appreciate Homer. Both Petrarch and Boccacio
spared no pains to acquaint themselves with the lost tongue. The latter
had succeeded in obtaining for Leontius Pilatus, the Calabrian, a Greek
professorship at Florence. He describes this Greek teacher as clad in the
mantle of a philosopher, his countenance hideous, his face overshadowed
with black hair, his beard long and uncombed, his deportment rustic, his
temper gloomy and inconstant, but his mind was stored with the treasures
of learning. Leontius left Italy in disgust, but, returning again, was
struck dead by lightning in a storm while tied to the mast of the ship.
The author from whom I am quoting significantly adds that Petrarch
laments his fate, but nervously asks whether "some copy of Euripides or
Sophocles might not be recovered from the mariners."</p>

<p>The restoration of Greek to Italy may be dated <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1395, at which time
Chrysoloras commenced teaching it. A few years after Aurispa brought into
Italy two hundred and thirty-eight Greek manuscripts; among them were
Plato and Pindar. The first endeavour was to translate such manuscripts
into Latin. To a considerable extent, the religious scruples against
Greek literature were giving way; the study found a patron in the pope
himself, Eugenius&nbsp;IV. As the intention of the Turks to seize
Constantinople became more obvious, the emigration of learned Greeks into
Italy became more frequent. And yet, with the exception of Petrarch, and
he was scarcely an exception, not one of the Italian scholars was an
ecclesiastic.</p>


<p><span class="side">Lorenzo de' Medici, his villas, gardens, and philosophy.</span> <span class="pag">[195]</span> <a id="Lorenzo195"></a>Lorenzo
 de' Medici, the grandson of Cosmo, used every exertion to
increase the rising taste, generously permitting his manuscripts to be
copied. Nor was it alone to literature that he extended his patronage. In
his beautiful villa at Fiesole the philosophy of the old times was
revived; his botanic garden at Careggi was filled with Oriental exotics.
From 1470 to 1492, the year of his death, his happy influence continued.
He lived to witness the ancient Platonism overcoming the Platonism of
Alexandria, and the pure doctrine of Aristotle expelling the base
Aristotelian doctrine of the schools.</p>


<p><span class="side">Effects instantly produced by the Greek language.</span>The last half of the fifteenth century revealed to Western Europe two
worlds, a new one and an old; the former by the voyage of Columbus, the
latter by the capture of Constantinople; one destined to revolutionize
the industrial, the other the religious condition. Greek literature,
forced into Italy by the Turkish arms, worked wonders; for Latin Europe
found with amazement that the ancient half of Christendom knew nothing
whatever of the doctrine or of the saints of the West. Now was divulged
the secret reason of that bitter hatred displayed by the Catholic clergy
to Grecian learning.
 <span class="side">Causes of the prevailing dislike of Greek.</span>
 It had sometimes been supposed that the
ill-concealed dislike they had so often shown to the writings of
Aristotle was because of the Arab dress in which his Saracen commentators
had presented him; now it appeared that there was something more
important, more profound. It was a terror of the Greek itself. Very soon
the direction toward which things must inevitably tend became manifest;
the modern languages, fast developing, were making Latin an obsolete
tongue, and political events were giving it a rival&mdash;Greek&mdash;capable of
asserting over it a supremacy; and not a solitary rival, for to Greek it
was clear that Hebrew would soon be added, bringing with it the charms of
a hoary antiquity and the sinister learning of the Jew. With a quick, a
jealous suspicion, the ecclesiastic soon learned to detect a heretic from
his knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, just as is done in our day from a
knowledge of physical science. The authority of the Vulgate, that
corner-stone of the Italian system, was, in the expectation of Rome,
<span class="pag">[196]</span> inevitably <a id="certain196"></a>certain to be depreciated; and, in truth, judging from the
honours of which that great translation was soon despoiled by the
incoming of Greek and Hebrew, it was declared, not with more emphasis
than truth, yet not, perhaps, without irreverence, that there was a
second crucifixion between two thieves. Long after the times of which we
are speaking, the University of Paris resisted the introduction of Greek
into its course of studies, not because of any dislike to letters, but
because of its anticipated obnoxious bearing on Latin theology.</p>


<p><span class="side">Tendency of "The Imitation of Christ." </span>We can scarcely look in any direction without observing instances of the
wonderful change taking place in the opinions of men. To that disposition
to lean on a privileged mediating order, once the striking characteristic
of all classes of the laity in Europe, there had succeeded a sentiment of
self-reliance. Of this perhaps mo better proof can be furnished than the
popularity of the work reputed to have been written by Thomas à Kempis,
and entitled "The Imitation of Christ." It is said to have had probably
more readers than any other book except the Bible. Its great celebrity is
a proof how profoundly ecclesiastical influence had been affected, for
its essential intention was to enable the pious to cultivate their
devotional feeling without the intervention of the clergy. Such a work,
if written in the present day, would have found an apt and popular title
in "Every Man his own Priest." There is no reason for supposing that the
condition to which man had at that time been brought, as the general
result of Italian Christianity, was one of intense selfishness, as has
been asserted; the celebrity of this book was rather dependent on a
profound distrust everywhere felt in the clergy, both as regards morals
and intellect. And why should we be surprised that such should be the
case with the laity, when in all directions the clergy themselves were
giving proof that they could not trust their own strength? They could not
conceal their dread at the incoming of Greek; they could not speak
without horror of the influence of Hebrew; they were loud in their
protestations against the study of pagan philosophy, and held up to the
derision and condemnation of the world science denounced by them as
<a id="foresaw197"></a>profane. <span class="pag">[197]</span>
<span class="side">Danger to the unity of the Church.</span>
They foresaw that that fictitious unity of which they had
boasted was drawing to an end; that men would become acquainted with the
existence and history of churches more ancient, and, therefore, more
venerable than the Roman, and, like it, asserting an authenticity upon
unimpeachable proofs. But once let sects with such an impressive prestige
be introduced to the knowledge of the West, once let the appearance of
inviolate unity be taken from the Latin Church, and nothing could prevent
a spontaneous decomposition forthwith occurring in it. It must break up
into sects, which, in their turn, must break up, in process of time, into
smaller and smaller divisions, and, through this means, the European must
emerge at last into individual liberty of thought. The compelling hand of
ecclesiastical tyranny must be removed, and universal toleration ensue.
Nor were such anticipations mere idle suspicions, for such was the course
that events actually took. Scarcely had the Reformation occurred when
sectarian subdivisions made their appearance, and in modern times we see
that an anarchy of sects is the inevitable harbinger of individual
liberty of thought.</p>


<p><span class="side">Higher requirements in evidence.</span>As we have just said, it was impossible to look in any direction on the
latter half of the fifteenth century without recognizing the wonderful
change. It had become obviously useless any longer to assert an
immobility of humanity when men were standing face to face with the new
forms into which it had been transposed. New ideas had driven out old
ones. Natural phenomena could not again be likened to human acts, nor the
necessities of man regarded as determining the movements of the universe.
A better appreciation of the nature of evidence was arising, perhaps in
part through the influence of the lawyers, but in part through a
commencing taste for criticism. We see it in such facts as the denial
that a miracle can be taken as the proof of anything else than the
special circumstances with which it is connected; we see it in the
assertion that the martyrdom of men in support of a dogma, so far from
proving its truth, proves rather its doubtfulness, no geometer having
ever thought it worth his while to die in order to establish any
<span class="pag">[198]</span> mathematical <a id="proposition198"></a>proposition, truth needing no such sacrifices, which are
actually unserviceable and useless to it, since it is able spontaneously
to force its own way.
<span class="side">Disbelief setting in in Italy.</span>
In Italy, where the popular pecuniary interests
were obviously identical with those of the Church, a dismal disbelief was
silently engendering.</p>

<p>And now occurred an event the results of which it is impossible to
exaggerate.</p>


<p><span class="side">Invention of printing: its early history.</span>About <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1440 the art of printing seems to have been invented in
Europe. It is not material to our purpose to inquire into the particulars
of its history, whether we should attribute it to Coster of Haarlaem or
Gutenberg of Mentz, or whether, in reality, it was introduced by the
Venetians from China, where it had been practised for nearly two thousand
years. In Venice a decree was issued in 1441 in relation to printing,
which would seem to imply that it had been known there for some years.
Coster is supposed to have printed the "Speculum Humanæ Salvationis"
about 1440, and Gutenberg and Faust the Mentz Bible without date, 1455.
The art reached perfection at once; their Bible is still admired for its
beautiful typography. Among the earliest specimens of printing extant is
an exhortation to take up arms against the Turks, 1454; there are also
two letters of indulgence of Nicolas&nbsp;V. of the same date. In the
beginning each page was engraved on a block of wood, but soon movable
types were introduced. Impressions of the former kind pass under the name
of block books; at first they were sold as manuscripts. Two of Faust's
workmen commenced printing in Italy, but not until 1465; they there
published an edition of "Lactantius," one of "Cicero de Officiis," and one
of "Augustine de Civitate Dei." The art was carried to France 1469, and
in a few years was generally practised in all the large European towns.
<span class="side">Early books and booksellers.</span>
The printers were their own booksellers; the number of copies in each
edition usually about three hundred. Folios were succeeded by quartos,
and in 1501 duodecimos were introduced. Very soon the price of books was
reduced by four fifths, and existing interests required regulations not
only respecting the cost, but also respecting the contents. Thus the
University of Paris established a tariff for <span class="pag">[199]</span> their <a id="sale199"></a>sale, and also
exercised a supervision in behalf of the Church, and the State. From the
outset it was clear that printing would inevitably influence the
intellectual movement synchronously occurring.</p>


<p><span class="side">Measure of the contemporaneous mental state of nations.</span>Some authors have endeavoured to estimate the intellectual condition of
different countries in Europe at the close of the fifteenth century by
the literary activity they displayed in the preparation and printing of
editions of books. Though it is plain that such estimates can hardly be
rigorously correct, since to print a book not only implies literary
capacity, but also the connexions of business and trade, and hence works
are more likely to be issued in places where there is a mercantile
activity, yet such estimates are perhaps the most exact that we can now
obtain; they also lead us to some very interesting and unexpected results
of singular value in their connexion with that important epoch. Thus it
appears that in all Europe, between 1470 and 1500, more than ten thousand
editions of books and pamphlets were printed, and of them a majority in
Italy, demonstrating that Italy was in the van of the intellectual
movement. Out of this large number, in Venice there had been printed
2,835; Milan, 625; Bologna, 298; Rome, 925; Paris, 751; Cologne, 530;
Nuremberg, 382; Leipsic, 851; Bâle, 320; Strasburg, 526; Augsburg, 256;
Louvain, 116; Mentz, 134; Deventer, 169; London, 130; Oxford, 7; St.
Alban's, 4.</p>


<p><span class="side">Italy compared with the rest of Europe.</span>Venice, therefore, took the lead. England was in a very backward state.
This conclusion is confirmed by many other circumstances, which justify
the statement that Italy was as far advanced intellectually in 1400 as
England in 1500. Paris exhibits a superiority sixfold over London, and in
the next ten years the disproportion becomes even more remarkable, for in
Paris four hundred and thirty editions were printed, in London only
twenty-six. The light of learning became enfeebled by distance from its
Italian focus. As late as 1550, a complete century after the
establishment of the art, but seven works had been printed in Scotland,
and among them not a single classic. It is an amusing proof how local
tastes were consulted in the character of the <span class="pag">[200]</span> books <a id="thus200"></a>thus put forth, that
the first work issued in Spain, 1474, was on the "Conception of the
Virgin."</p>


<p><span class="side">Effect of printing on literature and the Church.</span>The invention of printing operated in two modes altogether distinct;
first, in the multiplying and cheapening of books, secondly, in
substituting reading for pulpit instruction.</p>


<p><span class="side">Cheapening of books.</span>First, as to the multiplication and cheapening of books&mdash;there is no
reason to suppose that the supply had ever been inadequate. As, under the
Ptolemies, book manufacture was carried forward in the Museum at
Alexandria to an extent which fully satisfied demands, so in all the
great abbeys there was an apartment&mdash;the Scriptorium&mdash;for the copying and
making of books. Such a sedentary occupation could not but be agreeable
to persons of a contemplative or quiet habit of life. But Greece, Rome,
Egypt&mdash;indeed, all the ancient governments except that of China, were
founded upon elements among which did not appear that all-important one
of modern times, a reading class. Information passed from mouth to mouth,
not from eye to eye. With a limited demand, the compensation to the
copier was sufficient, and the cost to the purchaser moderate. It is
altogether a mistake to suppose that the methods and advantages of
printing were unknown. Modifications of that art were used wherever
occasion called for them. We do not need the Roman stamps to satisfy us
of that fact every Babylonian brick and signet ring is an illustration.
<span class="side"> The want of paper. Damascus paper.</span>
Printing processes of various kinds were well enough known. The real
difficulty was the want of paper. That substance was first made in Europe
by the Spanish Moors from the fine flax of Valentia and Murcia. Cotton
paper, sold as charta Damascena, had been previously made at Damascus,
and several different varieties had long been manufactured in China.</p>

<p>Had there been more readers, paper would have been more abundantly
produced, and there would have been more copiers&mdash;nay, even there would
have been printers. An increased demand would have been answered by an
increased supply. As soon as such a demand arose in Europe the press was
introduced, as it had been thousands of years before in China.</p>


<p><span class="side">Longevity of books curtailed.</span> <span class="pag">[201]</span> <a id="So201"></a>So far as the public is concerned, printing has been an unmixed
advantage; not so, however, in its bearing on authors. The longevity of
books is greatly impaired, a melancholy conclusion to an ambitious
intellect. The duration of many ancient books which have escaped the
chances of time is to be hoped for no more. In this shortening of their
term the excessive multiplication of works greatly assists. A rapid
succession soon makes those of distinction obsolete, and then consigns
them to oblivion. No author can now expect immortality. His utmost hope
is only this, that his book may live a little longer than himself.</p>


<p><span class="side">Multiplication of books.</span>But it was with printing as with other affairs of the market&mdash;an
increased demand gave origin to an increased supply, which, in its turn
reacting, increased the demand. Cheap books bred readers. When the monks,
abandoning their useless and lazy life of saying their prayers a dozen
times a day, turned to the copying and illustrating of manuscripts, a
mental elevation of the whole order was the result; there were more monks
who could read. And so, on the greater scale, as books through the press
became more abundant, there were more persons to whom they became a
necessity.</p>


<p><span class="side">The mode of communicating knowledge changes.</span>But, secondly, as to the change which ensued in the mode of communicating
information&mdash;a change felt instantly in the ecclesiastical, and, at a
later period, in the political world. The whole system of public worship
had been founded on the condition of a non-reading people; hence the
reading of prayers and the sermon. Whoever will attentively compare the
thirteenth with the nineteenth century cannot fail to see how essential
oral instruction was in the former, how subordinate in the latter.
<span class="side"> Injury to pulpit instruction.</span>
 The invention of the printing-press gave an instant, a formidable rival to
the pulpit. It made possible that which had been impossible before in
Christian Europe&mdash;direct communication between the government and the
people without any religious intermedium, and was the first step in that
important change subsequently carried out in America, the separation of
Church and state. Though in this particular the effect was desirable,  <span class="pag">[202]</span> in
<a id="another202"></a>another its advantages are doubtful, for the Church adhered to her
ancient method when it had lost very much of its real force, and this
even at the risk of falling into a lifeless and impassive condition.</p>


<p><span class="side">Influence of church services on the people.</span>And yet we must not undervalue the power once exercised on a non-reading
community by oral and scenic teachings. What could better instruct it
than a formal congregating of neighbourhoods together each Sabbath-day to
listen in silence and without questioning? In those great churches, the
architectural grandeur of which is still the admiration of our material
age, nothing was wanting to impress the worshipper. The vast pile, with
its turrets or spire pointing to heaven; its steep inclining roof; its
walls, with niches and statues; its echoing belfry; its windows of
exquisite hues and of every form, lancet, or wheel, or rose, through
which stole in the many-coloured light; its chapels, with their pictured
walls; its rows of slender, clustering columns, and arches tier upon
tier; its many tapering pendants; the priest emerging from his scenic
retreat; his chalice and forbidden wine; the covering paten, the cibory,
and the pix. Amid clouds of incense from smoking censers, the blaze of
lamps, and tapers, and branching candlesticks, the tinkling of silver
bells, the play of jewelled vessels and gorgeous dresses of violet,
green, and gold, banners and crosses were borne aloft through lines of
kneeling worshippers in processional services along the aisles. The
chanting of litanies and psalms gave a foretaste of the melodies of
heaven, and the voices of the choristers and sounds of the organ now
thundered forth glory to God in the highest, now whispered to the broken
in spirit peace.</p>


<p><span class="side">Influence of village churches.</span>If such were the influences in the cathedral, not less were those that
gathered round the little village church. To the peasant it was endeared
by the most touching incidents of his life. At its font his parents had
given him his name; at its altar he had plighted his matrimonial vows;
beneath the little grass mounds in its yard there awaited the
resurrection those who had been untimely taken away. Connected thus with
the profoundest and holiest sentiments  <span class="pag">[203]</span> of <a id="humanity203"></a>humanity, the pulpit was for
instruction a sole and sufficient means. Nothing like it had existed in
paganism. The irregular, ill-timed, occasional eloquence of the Greek
republican orators cannot for an instant be set in comparison with such a
steady and enduring systematic institution.</p>

<p>In a temporal as well as in a spiritual sense, the public authorities
appreciated its power. Queen Elizabeth was not the only sovereign who
knew how to thunder through a thousand pulpits.</p>


<p><span class="side">The pulpit yields to the press.</span>For a length of time, as might have been expected, considering its power
and favouring adventitious circumstances, the pulpit maintained itself
successfully against the press. Nevertheless, its eventual subordination
was none the less sure. If there are disadvantages in the method of
acquiring knowledge by reading, there are also signal advantages; for,
though upon the printed page the silent letters are mute and unsustained
by any scenic help, yet often&mdash;a wonderful contradiction&mdash;they pour forth
emphatic eloquence, that can make the heart leap with emotion, or kindle
on the cheek the blush of shame. The might of persuasiveness does not
always lie in articulate speech. The strong are often the silent. God
never speaks.</p>


<p><span class="side">Listening and reading.</span>There is another condition which gives to reading a great advantage over
listening. In the affairs of life, how wide is the difference between
having a thing done for us and doing it ourselves! In the latter case,
how great is the interest awakened, how much more thorough the
examination, how much more perfect the acquaintance. To listen implies
merely a passive frame of mind; to read, an active. But the latter is
more noble.</p>


<p><span class="side">Decline of pulpit influence.</span>From these and other such considerations, it might have been foreseen
that the printing-press would at last deprive the pulpit of its
supremacy, making it become ineffective, or reducing it to an ancillary
aid. It must have been clear that the time would arrive when, though
adorned by the eloquence of great and good men, the sermon would lose its
power for moving popular masses or directing public thought.</p>


<p><span class="side">Newspapers; their origin.</span>Upon temporal as well as ecclesiastical authority,  <span class="pag">[204]</span> the <a id="influence204"></a>influence of this
great change was also felt. During the Turkish war of 1563 newspapers
first made their appearance in Venice. They were in manuscript. The
"Gazette de France" commenced in 1631. There seems to be doubt as to the
authenticity of the early English papers reputed to have been published
during the excitement of the Spanish Armada, and of which copies remain
in the British Museum. It was not until the civil wars that, under the
names of Mercuries, Intelligences, etc., newspapers fairly established
themselves in England.</p>


<p><span class="side">Decline of power in parliamentary eloquence.</span>What I have said respecting the influence of the press upon religious
life applies substantially to civil life also. Oratory has sunk into a
secondary position, being every day more and more thoroughly supplanted
by journalism. No matter how excellent it may be in its sphere of action,
it is essentially limited, and altogether incompetent to the influencing
of masses of men in the manner which our modern social system requires.
Without a newspaper, what would be the worth of the most eloquent
parliamentary attempts? It is that which really makes them instruments of
power, and gives to them political force, which takes them out of a
little circle of cultivated auditors, and throws them broadcast over
nations.</p>


<p><span class="side">Dawn of the Reformation.</span>Such was the literary condition of Western Europe, such the new power
that had been found in the press. These were but initiatory to the great
drama now commencing. We have already seen that synchronously with this
intellectual there was a moral impulse coming into play. The two were in
harmony. At the time now occupying our attention there was a possibility
for the moral impulse to act under several different forms. The special
mode in which it came into effect was determined by the pecuniary
necessities of Italy. It very soon, however, assumed larger proportions,
and became what is known to us as the Reformation. The movement against
Rome that had been abandoned for a century was now recommenced.</p>


<p><span class="side">Variation of human thought.</span>The variation of human thought proceeds in a continuous manner, new ideas
springing out of old ones either  <span class="pag">[205]</span> as <a id="corrections205"></a>corrections or developments, but
never spontaneously originating. With them, as with organic forms, each
requires a germ, a seed. The intellectual phase of humanity observed at
any moment is therefore an embodiment of many different things. It is
connected with the past, is in unison with the present, and contains the
embryo of the future.</p>

<p>Human opinions must hence, of absolute necessity, undergo transformation.
What has been received by one generation as undoubted, to a subsequent
one becomes so conspicuously fallacious as to excite the wonder of those
who do not distinctly appreciate the law of psychical advance that it
could ever have been received as true. These phases of transformation are
not only related in a chronological way, so as to be obvious when we
examine the ideas of society at epochs of a few years or of centuries
apart&mdash;they exist also contemporaneously in different nations or in
different social grades of the same nation, according as the class of
persons considered has made a greater or less intellectual progress.</p>


<p><span class="side">Variations in Italian ideas.</span>Notwithstanding the assertion of Rome, the essential ideas of the Italian
system had undergone unavoidable modifications. An illiterate people,
easily imposed upon, had accepted as true the asseveration that there had
been no change even from the apostolic times. But the time had now come
when that fiction could no longer be maintained, the divergence no longer
concealed. In the new state of things, it was impossible that dogmas in
absolute opposition to reason, such as that of transubstantiation, could
any longer hold their ground. The scholastic theology and scholastic
philosophy, though supported by the universities, had become obsolete.
With the revival of pure Latinity and the introduction of Greek, the
foundations of a more correct criticism were laid. An age of erudition
was unavoidable, in which whatever could not establish its claims against
a searching examination must necessarily be overthrown.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Reformation: its history.</span>We are thus brought to the great movement known as the Reformation. The
term is usually applied in reference to the Protestant nations, and
therefore is not sufficiently comprehensive,  <span class="pag">[206]</span> for <a id="all206"></a>all Europe was in truth
involved. A clear understanding of its origin, its process, its effects,
is perhaps best obtained by an examination of the condition of the
northern and southern nations, and the issue of the event in each
respectively.</p>


<p><span class="side">The preparatory state of Germany, France, England.</span>Germany had always been sincere, and therefore always devout. Of her
disposition she had given many proofs from the time when the Emperor Otho
descended into Italy, his expedition having been, as was said, an armed
procession of ecclesiastics resolved to abate the scandals of the Church.
The Councils of Constance and Basle may be looked upon as an embodiment
of the same sentiment. The resolution to limit the papal authority and to
put a superior over the pope arose from a profound conviction of the
necessity of such a measure. Those councils were precursors of the coming
Reformation. In other countries events had long been tending in the same
direction: in Sicily and Italy by the acts of Frederick&nbsp;II.; in France
through those of Philip the Fair. The educated had been estranged by the
Saracens and Jews; the enthusiastic by such works as the Everlasting
Gospel; the devout had been shocked by the tale of the Templars and the
detected immoralities in Rome; the patriotic had been alienated by the
assumptions of the papal court and its incessant intermeddling in
political affairs; the inferior, unreflecting orders were in all
directions exasperated by its importunate, unceasing exactions of money.
In England, for instance, though less advanced intellectually than the
southern nations, the commencement of the Reformation is perhaps justly
referred as far back as the reign of Edward&nbsp;III., who, under the
suggestion of Wiclif, refused to do homage to the pope, but a series of
weaker princes succeeding, it was not until Henry&nbsp;VII. that the movement
could be continued. In that country the immediately exciting causes were
no doubt of a material kind, such as the alleged avarice and impurity of
the clergy, the immense amount of money taken from the realm, the
intrusion of foreign ecclesiastics. In the South of France and in Italy,
where the intellectual condition was much more advanced, the movement was
correspondingly  <span class="pag">[207]</span> of a <a id="more207"></a>more intellectual kind. To this difference between
the north and the south must be referred not only the striking
geographical distribution of belief which was soon apparent, but also the
speedy and abrupt limitation of the Reformation, restrictedly so called.</p>



<p><span class="side">The theory of supererogation,</span>In recent ages, under her financial pressure, Rome had asserted that the
infinite merits of our Saviour, together with the good works of
supererogation of many holy men, constituted, as it were, a fund from
which might be discharged penalties of sins of every kind, for the dead
as well as the living, and therefore available for those who had passed
into Purgatory, as well as for us who remain.
<span class="side">and nature of indulgences.</span>
 This fund, committed to the
care of St. Peter and his successors, may be disbursed, under the form of
indulgences, by sale for money. A traffic in indulgences was thus carried
on to a great extent through the medium of the monks, who received a
commission upon the profits. Of course, it is plain that the religious
conception of such a transaction is liable to adverse criticism&mdash;the
bartering for money so holy a thing as the merit of our Redeemer. This
was, however, only the ostensible explanation, which it was judged
necessary to present to sincerely pious communities: behind it there lay
the real reason, which was essentially of a political kind. It was
absolutely necessary that papal Rome should control a revenue far beyond
that arising in a strictly legitimate way. As all the world had been
drained of money by the senate and Cæsars for the support of republican
or imperial power, so too there was a need of a like supply for the use
of the pontiffs. The collection of funds had often given rise to
contentions between the ecclesiastical and temporal authorities, and in
some of the more sturdy countries had been resolutely resisted. To
collect a direct tax is often a troublesome affair; but such is human
nature&mdash;a man from whom it might be difficult to extort the payment of an
impost lawfully laid, will often cheerfully find means to purchase for
himself indulgence for sin. In such a semi-barbarian but yet religious
population as that with which the Church was dealing, it was quite clear
that this manner of presenting things possessed  <span class="pag">[208]</span> singular <a id="advantages208"></a>advantages, an
obvious equivalent being given for the money received. The indulgence
implied not only a release from celestial, but also, in many cases, from
civil penalties. It was an absolute guarantee from hell.</p>


<p><span class="side">Martin Luther. </span>It is said that the attention of Martin Luther, formerly an Augustinian
monk, was first attracted to this subject by the traffic having been
conferred on the Dominicans instead of upon his own order at the time
when Leo&nbsp;X. was raising funds by this means for building St. Peter's at
Rome, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1517. That was probably only an insinuation of Luther's
adversaries, and is very far from being borne out by his subsequent
conduct. His first public movement was the putting forth of ninety-five
theses against the practice. He posted them on the door of the cathedral
of Wittenberg, and enforced them in his sermons, though at this time he
professed obedience to the papal authority. With a rapidity probably
unexpected by him, his acts excited public attention so strongly, that,
though the pope was at first disposed to regard the whole affair as a
mere monkish squabble for gains, it soon became obvious, from the manner
in which the commotion was spreading, that something must be done to
check it. The pope therefore summoned Luther to Rome to answer for
himself; but through the influence of certain great personages, and
receiving a submissive letter from the accused, he, on reconsideration,
referred the matter to Cardinal Cajetan, his legate in Germany. The
cardinal, on looking into the affair, ordered Luther to retract; and now
came into prominence the mental qualities of this great man. Luther, with
respectful firmness, refused; but remembering John Huss, and fearing that
the imperial safe-conduct which had been given to him would be
insufficient for his protection, he secretly returned to Wittenberg,
having first, however, solemnly appealed from the pope, ill informed at
the time, to the pope when he should have been better instructed.
Thereupon he was condemned as a heretic. Undismayed, he continued to
defend his opinions, but, finding himself in imminent danger, he fell
upon the suggestion which, since the days of Philip the Fair, had been
recognized as the true method of dealing with  <span class="pag">[209]</span> the <a id="papacy209"></a>papacy, and appealed
to a general council as the true representative of the Church, and
therefore superior to the pope, who is not infallible any more than St.
Peter himself had been. To this denial of papal authority he soon added a
dissent from the doctrines of purgatory, auricular confession,
absolution.
<span class="side">The right of individual judgment asserted.</span>
It was now that the grand idea which had hitherto silently
lain at the bottom of the whole movement emerged into prominence&mdash;the
right of individual judgment&mdash;under the dogma that it is not papal
authority which should be the guide of life, but the Bible, and that the
Bible is to be interpreted by private judgment. Thus far it had been
received that the Bible derives its authenticity and authority from the
Church; now it was asserted that the Church derives her authenticity and
authority from the Bible. At this moment there was but one course for the
Italian court to take with the audacious offender, for this new doctrine
of the right of exercising private judgment in matters of faith was
dangerous to the last extreme, and not to be tolerated for a moment.
<span class="side">Excommunication of Luther.</span>
Luther was therefore ordered to recant, and to burn his own works, under
penalty, if disobedient, of being excommunicated, and delivered over unto
Satan. The bull thus issued directed all secular princes to seize his
person and punish his crimes.</p>



<p><span class="side">He resists, and publicly burns the bull,</span>But Luther was not to be intimidated; nay, more, he retaliated. He
denounced the pope, as Frederick and the Fratricelli had formerly done,
as the Man of Sin, the Anti-Christ. He called upon all Christian princes
to shake off his tyranny. In presence of a great concourse of applauding
spectators, he committed the volumes of the canon law and the bull of
excommunication to the flames. The pope now issued another bull expelling
him from the Church. This was in January, 1521. This separation opened to
Luther an unrestrained career. He forthwith proceeded to an examination
of the Italian system of theology and policy, in which he was joined by
many talented men who participated in his views. The Emperor Charles&nbsp;V.
found it necessary to use all his influence to check the spreading
Reformation.  <span class="pag">[210]</span> But <a id="it210"></a>it was already too late, for Luther had obtained the
firm support of many personages of influence, and his doctrines were
finding defenders among some of the ablest men in Europe.</p>

<p>An imperial diet was therefore held at Worms, before which Luther, being
summoned, appeared. But nothing could induce him to retract his opinions.
An edict was published putting him under the ban of the empire; but the
Elector of Saxony concealed him in the castle of Wartburg.
<span class="side"> and the revolt spreads.</span>
While he was in this retirement his doctrines were rapidly extending, the Augustinians
of Wittenberg not hesitating to change the usages of the Church,
abolishing private masses, and giving the cup as well as the bread to the
laity.</p>

<p><span class="side">The Swiss Reformation. Zuinglius.</span>While Germany was agitated to her centre, a like revolt against Italian
supremacy broke out in Switzerland. It too commenced on the question of
indulgences, and found a leader in Zuinglius.</p>

<p>Even at this early period the inevitable course of events was beginning
to be plainly displayed in sectarian decomposition; for, while the German
and Swiss Reformers agreed in their relation toward the papal authority,
they differed widely from each other on some important doctrinal points,
more especially as to the nature of the Eucharist. The Germans supposed
that the body and blood of Christ are actually present in the bread and
wine in some mysterious way; the Swiss believed that those substances are
only emblems or symbols. Both totally rejected the Italian doctrine of
transubstantiation. The old ideas of Berengar were therefore again
fermenting among men. An attempt was made, under the auspices of the
Landgrave of Hesse, to compose the dissension in a conference at Marburg;
but it was found, after a long disputation, that neither party would give
up its views, and they therefore separated, as it was said, in Christian
charity, but not in brotherhood.</p>

<p>At the first Diet of Spires, held in 1526, it was tried to procure the
execution of the sentence passed upon Luther, but the party of the
Reformation proved to be too strong for the Catholics. At a second diet,
held at the same place three years subsequently, it was resolved that <span class="pag">[211]</span> no
<a id="change211"></a>change should be made in the established religion before the action of a
general council, which had been recommended by both diets, should be
known. On this occasion the Catholic interest preponderated sufficiently
to procure a revocation of the power which had been conceded to the
princes of the empire of managing for a time the ecclesiastical matters
of their own dominions.
<span class="side">The Protestants; origin of the name. </span>
 Against this action several of the princes and
cities <i>protested</i>, this being the origin of the designation Protestants
subsequently given to the Reformers. At a diet held the following year at
Augsburg, a statement, composed by Luther and Melanchthon, of the
doctrines of the Reformers was presented; it also treated to some extent
of the errors and superstitions of the Catholics. This is what is known
as the Confession of Augsburg.
<span class="side">Organization of the Reformation.</span>
 The diet however not only rejected it, but
condemned most of its doctrines. The Protestants, therefore, in an
assembly at Smalcalde, contracted a treaty for their common defence, and
this may be looked upon as the epoch of organization of the Reformation.
This league did not include the Reformers of Switzerland, who could not
conscientiously adopt the Confession of Augsburg, which was its essential
basis. The Sacramentarians, as they were called, became thus politically
divided from the Lutherans. Moreover, in Switzerland the process of
decomposition went on, Calvin establishing a new sect, characterized by
the manner in which it insisted on the Augustinian doctrines of
predestination and election, by the abolition of all festivals, and the
discontinuance of Church ceremonies. At a later period the followers of
Zuinglius and Calvin coalesced.</p>

<p><span class="side">Its culmination. Peace of Westphalia.</span>The political combinations which had thus occurred as Protestantism
rapidly acquired temporal power gave rise, as might have been
anticipated, to wars. The peace of Augsburg, 1555, furnished the
Reformers the substantial advantages they sought&mdash;freedom from Italian
ecclesiastical authority, the right of all Germans to judge for
themselves in matters of religion, equality in civil privileges for them
and the Catholics. A second time, sixty-four years <span class="pag">[212]</span> subsequently, <a id="war212"></a>war
broke out&mdash;the Thirty Years' War&mdash;and finally the dispute was composed by
the treaty of Westphalia. This may be regarded as the culmination of the
Reformation. Peace was made in spite of all the intrigues and opposition
of Rome.</p>


<p><span class="side">Extent of the movement.</span>
The doctrines of the Reformation were adopted with singular avidity
throughout the north of Europe, and established themselves for a time in
France and in Italy. Even as early as 1558 a report of the Venetian
ambassador estimates the Catholics of the German empire at only one-tenth
of the population. For twenty years not a student of the University of
Vienna had become a priest.</p>


<p><span class="side">The revolt in Italy.</span>Such was the Reformation among the German nations. It is not possible,
however, to comprehend correctly that great movement without
understanding the course of events in Italy, for that peninsula was
involved, though in a very different way. In its intellectual condition
it was far in advance of the rest of Europe, as is proved by such facts
as those to which we have alluded respecting the printing of books.
Between it and the nations of which we have been speaking there was also
a wide difference in material interests. What was extorted from them was
enjoyed by it. The mental and material condition of Italy soon set a
limit to the progress of the Reformation.</p>


<p><span class="side">Position of the Italians.</span>The Italians had long looked upon the transalpine nations with contempt.
On the principle that the intellectually strong may lawfully prey on the
intellectually weak, they had systematically drained them of their
wealth. As we exchange with savages beads, and looking-glasses, and
nails, for gold, they had driven a profitable barter with the valiant but
illiterate barbarians, exchanging possessions in heaven for the wealth of
the earth, and selling for money immunities or indulgences for sin. But
in another respect they had looked upon them with dread&mdash;they had felt
the edge of the French and German sword. The educated classes, though
seeking the widest liberty of thought for themselves, were not disposed
to more than a very select propagandism of opinions, which plainly could
only <span class="pag">[213]</span> be <a id="detrimental213"></a>detrimental to the pecuniary interests of their country. Their
faith had long ago ceased to be that of conviction; it had become a mere
outward patriotic acquiescence. Even those who were willing enough to
indulge themselves in the utmost latitude of personal free-thinking never
made an objection when some indiscreet zealot of their own kind was
compelled by ecclesiastical pressure to flee beyond the Alps. No part of
Europe was so full of irreligion as Italy. It amounted to a philosophical
infidelity among the higher classes; to Arianism among the middle and
less instructed; to an utter carelessness, not even giving itself the
trouble of disbelief, among the low.
<span class="side">State of their universities.</span>
 The universities and learned
academies were hotbeds of heresy; thus the University of Padua was
accused of having been for long a focus of atheism, and again and again
learned academies, as those of Modena and Venice, had been suppressed for
heresy.
<span class="side">State of the learned academies.</span>
The device of the Academy of the Lyncei indicated only too
plainly the spirit of these institutions; it was a lynx, with its eyes
turned upward to heaven, tearing the triple-headed Cerberus with its
claws. Nor was this alarming condition restricted to Italy; France had
long participated in it. From the University of Paris, that watch-tower
of the Church, the alarm had often been sounded; now it was against men,
now against books. Once, under its suggestions, the reading of the
physics and metaphysics of Aristotle had been prohibited, and works of
philosophy interdicted until they should have been corrected by the
theologians of the Church. The physical heresies of Galileo, the
pantheism of Cæsalpinus had friendly counterparts in France. Even the
head of the Church, Leo&nbsp;X., at the beginning of the Reformation, could
not escape obloquy, and stories were circulated touching his elevation to
the pontificate at once prejudicial to his morals and to his belief.</p>


<p><span class="side">False position of the papacy.</span>In such an ominous condition, the necessity of carrying out the policy to
which Italy had so long been committed perpetually forced the papal
Government to acts against which the instructed judgment of its own
officials revolted. It was a continual struggle between their duty and
their disposition. Why <span class="pag">[214]</span> should <a id="they214"></a>they have thought it expedient to suppress
the Koran when it was printed in Venice, 1530? why, when Paul&nbsp;IV., 1559,
promulgated the Index Expurgatorius of prohibited books, was it found
necessary that not less than forty-eight editions of the Bible should be
included in it, sixty-one printers put under the ban, and all their
publications forbidden, at first the interdict being against all
prohibited books, and, on this being found insufficient, even those that
had not been permitted being prohibited? Why was it that Galileo was
dealt with so considerately and yet so malignantly? It was plain that
toleration, either of men or books, was altogether irreconcilable with
the principles of the Holy See, and that under its stern exigencies the
former must be disposed of, and the latter suppressed or burnt, no matter
what personal inclinations or favouring sentiments might be in the way.
If any faltering took place in the carrying out of this determination,
the control of Rome over the human mind would be put into the most
imminent jeopardy.</p>


<p><span class="side">Check of the Reformation in Italy.</span>So stood affairs in Italy at the beginning and during the active period
of the Reformation, the ancient system inexorably pressing upon the
leading men, and impelling them to acts against which their better
judgment revolted. They were bound down to the interests of their
country, those interests being interwoven with conditions which they
could no longer intellectually accept. For men of this class the German
and Swiss reformations did not go far enough. They affirmed that things
were left just as inconsistent, with reason, just as indefensible as
before. Doubtless they considered that the paring away of the worship of
saints, of absolution for money, penances, indulgences, freedom from
papal taxation, the repudiation of intrusive foreign ecclesiastics, was
all to the detriment of the pecuniary interests of Italy. They affirmed
that the doctrines put forth by the Reformers made good their ground, not
through the force of reason, but through appeals to the ignorant, and
even to women; not through an improved and sounder criticism, but, as it
was declared, through the inward light of the Spirit; that nothing had
been done to alleviate the ancient intolerant dogmatism, the <span class="pag">[215]</span> forcible
<a id="suppression215"></a>suppression of freedom of thought.
<span class="side">Leo&nbsp;X.; his character.</span>
 Leo&nbsp;X., it is well known, at first
altogether mistook the nature of the Reformation. He was a man of refined
tastes and pleasure, delighting in sumptuous feasts, and too often
scandalizing the devout by his indecent conversation and licentious
conduct. He gloried in being the patron of the learned, devoting all his
attention to the progress of literature and the fine arts, a connoisseur
in antiques. The amenities of the life of an accomplished gentleman were
not to be disturbed. He little dreamt that in the coarse German monk
there was an antagonist worthy of the papacy. The gay Italians looked
upon Luther with ineffable contempt, as introducing ideas even more
absurd than those he was trying to displace, and, what was perhaps a
still greater offence, upholding his bad doctrines in worse Latin. They
affected to believe that they discerned a taint of insanity in the
Reformer's account of his conflicts with the Devil, yet were willing to
concede that there was a method in his madness, since he was bent on
having a wife. In their opinion, the result of the German movement must
be exceedingly detrimental to learning, and necessarily lead to the
production of very vulgar results, exciting among the common people a
revolutionary and destructive spirit. Nor was this personal distaste for
Luther altogether undeserved. The caricatures which that great man
permitted himself to put forth are too indelicate to be described to a
modern reader. They would be worthy of our disgust and indignation did we
not find some palliation in the coarseness of the communities and times
in which he lived. Leo awoke to his blunder when it was too late, and
found that he had been superciliously sneering at what he should have
combated with all his might.</p>


<p><span class="side">Check of the Reformation in Europe.</span>It is now more than three centuries since the Reformation commenced, and
we are able, with some degree of accuracy, to ascertain its influence.
Founded as it was on the right of private interpretation of the
Scriptures, it introduced a better rule of life, and made a great advance
towards intellectual liberty. It compelled men to be more moral, and
permitted them to be more learned. For the traditions <span class="pag">[216]</span> of <a id="superstition216"></a>superstition it
substituted the dictates of common sense; it put an end to the
disgraceful miracles that for so many ages had been the scandal of
Europe. The assertion of the Italians that it was a great injury to
letters is untrue. Though not to be regarded in any respect as a learned
man, Luther approved of the study of Greek and Hebrew, recognized by all
parties to be dangerous to the Latin system. And even if the accusation
be admitted that he approved of their cultivation, not from any love of
them, but from hatred to it, the world was equally a gainer. Toward the
close of his life it seemed as if there was no other prospect for papal
power than total ruin: yet at this day, out of three hundred millions of
Christians, more than half owe allegiance to Rome. Almost as if by
enchantment the Reformation suddenly ceased to advance. Rome was not only
able to check its spread, but even to gain back a portion of what she had
lost.
<span class="side">Its causes were not supernatural.</span>
 The cause of this, which may seem at first an extraordinary result,
is not to be attributed to any supernatural influence, as some have
supposed. When natural causes suffice, it is needless to look for
supernatural.</p>

<p>Though there might be sovereigns who, like Henry&nbsp;VIII., had personal
reasons for discontent with the Italian court; though there were some who
sought to usurp the power and prerogatives of the popes; though there
might be nobles who, as the Prince of Wales's tutor wrote to Sir W.
Paget, were "importunate wolves, as are able to devour chantries,
cathedral churches, universities, and a thousand times as much;" some who
desired the plunder of establishments endowed by the piety of ages, and
who therefore lent all their influence in behalf of this great
revolution; there was among such and above such that small but
all-important body of men who see human affairs from the most general
point of view.
<span class="side">Influence of statesmen and philosophers.</span>
To these, whatever might be the nation to which they
happened to belong, it was perfectly evident that the decomposition of
faith which had set in, if permitted to go on unchecked, could not
possibly end in any other way than in producing an anarchy of sects. In
their opinion, the German Reformation <span class="pag">[217]</span> did <a id="not217"></a>not go far enough. It still
practically left untouched the dependency of the Church upon the State.
In the southern nations of the Continent it had merely irritated the
great European ulcer, whereas what was required was the complete
amputation of the rotten mass. In their judgment it was better to leave
things as they were until a thorough eradication could be accomplished,
and this, at the time, was obviously impossible. Not understanding,
perhaps, how much human affairs are developed according to law, and how
little by the volition of individuals, they liberally conceded that
Catholicism had been the civilizing agency of Europe, and had become
inwoven with the social fabric for good or for evil. It could not now be
withdrawn without pulling the whole texture to pieces. Moreover, the
curtain of papal authority, which at one time enveloped all Europe in its
ample folds, had, in the course of these late events, been contracted and
stretched across the Continent, dividing the northern and southern
nations from each other. The people of the south saw on its embroidered
surface nothing but forms of usefulness and beauty, they on the north a
confusion of meaningless threads. But the few who considered it as a
whole, and understood the relations of both sides, knew well enough that
the one is the necessary incident of the other, and that it is quite as
useless to seek for explanations as to justify appearances. To them it
was perfectly clear that the tranquillity and happiness of Christendom
were best subserved by giving no encouragement to opinions which had
already occasioned so much trouble, and which seemed to contain in their
very constitution principles of social disorganization.</p>


<p><span class="side">Influence of the nature of the Reformation.</span>A reason for the sudden loss of expansive force in the Reformation is
found in its own intrinsic nature. The principle of decomposition which
it represented, and with which it was inextricably entangled, necessarily
implied oppugnancy. For a short season the attention of Protestantism was
altogether directed to the papal authority from which it had so recently
separated itself; but, with its growing strength and ascertained
independence, that object ceased to occupy it, becoming, as it were, more
distant and more obscure. <span class="pag">[218]</span> <a id="Upon218"></a>Upon the subordinate divisions which were springing from it, or which
were of collateral descent from the original Catholic stock, the whole
view of each denomination was concentrated. The bitterness once directed
against the papacy lost none of its intensity when pointed at rivals or
enemies nearer home. Nor was it alone dissensions among the greater
sects, oppositions such as those between the Church of England and the
Church of Scotland, whose discords were founded on points admitted by all
to be great and essential; the same principle ran down through all the
modes of sectarian combination as they emerged into life, producing among
those of equal power struggles, and in the strong toward the weak
persecution.
<span class="side">Effect of sectarian disputes.</span>
Very soon the process of decomposition had advanced to such
an extent that minor sects came into existence on very unessential
points. Yet even among these little bodies there was just as much
acrimony, just as much hatred as among the great. These differences were
carried into the affairs of civil life, each sect forming a society
within itself, and abstaining, as far as might be, from associations with
its rivals. Of such a state of things the necessary result was weakness,
and, had there been no other reason, this in itself would have been quite
sufficient in the end to deprive Protestantism of its aggressive power.
An army divided against itself is in no condition to make warfare against
a watchful and vigorous enemy.</p>


<p><span class="side">Want of concentrated power.</span>But this was not all. It was in the nature of Protestantism from its
outset that it was not constructive. Unlike its great antagonist, it
contained no fundamental principle that could combine distant communities
and foreign countries together. It originated in dissent, and was
embodied by separation. It could not possess a concentrated power, nor
recognize one apostolic man who might compress its disputes, harmonize
its powers, wield it as a mass. For the attainment of his aims the
Protestant had only wishes, the Catholic had a will. The Church of
England, of Scotland, or of any other Protestant nation, undoubtedly did
discharge its duty excellently well for the community in which it was
placed, but, at the most, it was <span class="pag">[219]</span> only a <a id="purely219"></a>purely local institution,
altogether insignificant in comparison with that great old Church, hoary
and venerable with age, which had seen every government and every
institution in Europe come into existence, many of them at its bidding,
which had extirpated paganism from the Roman empire, compelled the Cæsars
to obey its mandates, precipitated the whole white race upon the Holy
Land&mdash;that great old Church, once the more than imperial sovereign of
Christendom, and of which the most respectable national Church was only a
fragment of a fragment.</p>


<p><span class="side">Condition of Catholicism.</span>Very different was it with Catholicism. It possessed an organization
which concentrated in the hand of one man irresistible power, and
included all the southern countries of Europe not Mohammedan. It could
enforce its policy by the armies and fleets of obedient kings. It is not
surprising, when this state of things is considered, that the spread of
the Reformation was limited to its first fervour&mdash;that the men who saw
its origin saw also its culmination. It is not to be wondered at that,
with the political weakening arising from a tendency to subdivision and
disintegration on one side, and the preparing of a complete and effective
organization against the danger that was threatening on the other, the
issue should have turned out as it did.</p>


<p><span class="side">The means of resistance resorted to by Rome.</span>Rome, awaking at last to her danger, met the Reformation with four
weapons&mdash;a counter-reformation, an increased vigour in the Inquisition,
the institution of the Jesuits, and a greater embellishment of worship.
The disposition of the northern nations was to a simplification of
worship, that of the south to adorn it with whatever could captivate the
senses. Ranke asserts that the composition of the mass of Marcellus by
Palestrina, 1560, had a wonderful effect in the revival of religion;
there can be no doubt that it constituted an epoch in devotion.
<span class="side">A counter-reformation.</span>
But of all these, the first and best was a moral change which she instantly
imposed upon herself. Henceforth it was her intention that in the chair
of St. Peter should never again be seen atheists, poisoners, thieves,
murderers, blasphemers, adulterers, but men, who, if they were sometimes
found, as must be the case, considering the <span class="pag">[220]</span> infirmities <a id="of220"></a>of humanity,
incompetent to deal with the great trials which often befell them, were
yet of such personal purity, holiness of life, and uprightness of
intention as to command profound respect. Those scandals that hitherto
had everywhere disgraced her began to disappear, a true reformation, but
not a schism, occurring through all ecclesiastical grades. Had
Protestantism produced no other result than this, it would have been an
unspeakable blessing to the world.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Inquisition brought into activity.</span>By another very different means the Italian power sought to insure its
domination&mdash;by an increased activity of the Inquisition. It is difficult
to understand how men of capacity could have justified this iniquitous
institution. Certainly it could not have been upon any principles of
Christian morality, nor even upon those of high statesmanship. For the
Inquisition to accomplish its purpose, it must needs be as all-seeing as
Providence, as inexorable as the grave; not inflicting punishments which
the sufferer could remember, but remorselessly killing outright; not
troubling itself to ascertain the merits of a case and giving the accused
the benefit of a doubt, but regarding suspicion and certainty as the same
thing. If worked with the unscrupulous, impassive resolution of
Machiavellianism, this great engine for the coercion of the human mind
could be made to accomplish its purpose. It thoroughly extinguished
Protestantism in Spain and Italy, and in those countries maintained a
barrier against the progressive reason of man.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Jesuits are established.</span>But the most effective weapon to which the papacy resorted was the
institution of the order of the Jesuits. This was established by a bull
of Paul&nbsp;III., 1540, the rules being that the general, chosen for life,
should be obeyed as God; that they should vow poverty, chastity,
obedience, and go wherever they were commanded; their obedience was to
the pope, not to the Church&mdash;a most politic distinction, for thereby an
unmistakable responsibility was secured. They had no regular hours of
prayer; their duties were preaching, the direction of consciences,
education. By the Jesuits Rome penetrated into the remotest corners of
the earth, <span class="pag">[221]</span> established <a id="links221"></a>links of communication with her children who
remained true to her in the heart of Protestant countries, and, with a
far-seeing policy for the future, silently engrossed the education of the
young. At the confessional she extorted from women the hidden secrets of
their lives and those of their families, took the lead in devotion
wherever there were pious men, and was equally foremost in the world of
fashion and dissipation.
<span class="side">Their influence all over the world.</span>
 There was no guise under which the Jesuit might
not be found&mdash;a barefoot beggar, clothed in rags; a learned professor,
lecturing gratuitously to scientific audiences; a man of the world,
living in profusion and princely extravagance; there have been Jesuits
the wearers of crowns. There were no places into which they did not find
their way: a visitor to one of the loyal old families of England could
never be sure but that there was a Jesuit hidden in the garret or
secreted behind the wainscot of the bedroom. They were the advisers of
the leading men of the age, sat in the cabinets of kings, and were their
confessors. They boasted that they were the link between religious
opinion and literature. With implicit and unquestioning obedience to his
superior, like a good soldier, it was the paramount duty of the Jesuit to
obey his orders, whatever those orders might be. It was for him to go, at
the summons of a moment, with his life in his hand, to the very centre of
pagan or of reformed and revolted countries, where his presence was death
by law, and execute the mission intrusted to him. If he succeeded, it was
well; if he should fall, it was also well. To him all things were proper
for the sake of the Church. It was his business to consider how the
affair he had in hand was to be most surely accomplished&mdash;to resort to
justifiable means if they should appear sufficient, if not, to
unjustifiable; to the spiritual weapon, but also to be prepared with the
carnal; to sacrifice candour if the occasion should require, if necessary
even truth, remembering that the end justifies the means, if that end is
the good of the Church.</p>

<p>While some religious orders were founded on retirement, and aimed at
personal improvement by solitude, the Jesuits were instructed to mix in
the affairs of men, <span class="pag">[222]</span> and <a id="gather222"></a>gather experience in the ways of worldly wisdom.
And since it is the infirmity of humanity, whatever may be the vigour of
its first intentions, too often to weary in well-doing, provision was
made to re-enforce the zeal of those becoming lukewarm to admonish the
delinquent, by making each a spy on all the others, under oath to reveal
everything to his superior. In that manner a control was exercised over
the brotherhood in all parts of the world. In Europe they had, in a very
short time, stealthily but largely engrossed public education; had mixed
themselves up with every public affair; were at the bottom of every
intrigue, making their power felt through the control they exerted over
sovereigns, ministers of state, and great court ladies, influencing the
last through the spiritual means of the confessional, or by the more
natural but equally effectual entanglements of requited love. Already
they had recognized the agency of commerce in promoting and diffusing
religious belief, and hence simultaneously became great missionaries and
great merchants. With the Indies, East and West, they carried forward
extensive commercial undertakings, and had depôts in various parts of
Europe. In these operations they were necessarily absolved from their
vows of poverty, and became immensely rich. In South America they
obtained a footing in Paraguay, and commenced their noble attempt at the
civilization of the Indians, bringing them into communities, teaching
them social usages, agricultural arts, and the benefits arising to
themselves and the community from labour. They gave them a military
organization, subdivided according to the European system, into the
customary arms&mdash;infantry, cavalry, artillery; they supplied them with
munitions of war. It was their hope that from this basis they should be
able to spread the rule of the Church over America, as had been done in
preceding ages over Europe.</p>


<p><span class="side">Causes of their suppression.</span>An intolerable apprehension of their invisible presence and unscrupulous
agency made all Europe put them down at last. The amenities of exquisite
courteousness, the artifices of infinite dissimulation, cannot for ever
deceive. Men found, by bitter experience, that within the silken glove
there was an iron hand. From their general in Rome, who was  <span class="pag">[223]</span> absolute
<a id="commander223"></a>commander of their persons and unchallengeable administrator of their
prodigious wealth, down to the humblest missionary who was wearing away
his life among the Andes, or on the banks of the Hoang-ho, or in the
solitary prairies of Missouri, or under the blazing sun of
Abyssinia&mdash;whether he was confessing the butterfly ladies of Paris,
whispering devilish suggestions into the ear of the King of Spain,
consoling the dying peasant in an Irish cabin, arguing with mandarins in
the palace of the Emperor of China, stealing away the hearts of the
rising generation in the lower schools and academies, extorting the
admiration of learned societies by the profundity of his philosophy and
the brilliancy of his scientific discoveries&mdash;whether he was to be seen
in the exchanges and marts of the great capitals, supervising commercial
operations on a scale which up to that time had been attempted by none
but the Jews&mdash;whether he was held in an English jail as a suspected
vagabond, or sitting on the throne of France&mdash;whether he appeared as a
great landed proprietor, the owner of countless leagues in the remote
parts of India or South America, or whether he was mixing with crowds in
the streets of London, and insinuating in Protestant ears the rights of
subjects to oppose and even depose their monarchs, or in the villages of
Castile and Leon, preaching before Catholic peasants the paramount duty
of a good Christian implicitly to obey the mandates of his king&mdash;wherever
the Jesuit was, or whatever he was doing, men universally felt that the
thing he had in hand was only auxiliary to some higher, some hidden
design. This stealth, and silence and power became at last so intolerable
that the Jesuits were banished from France, Spain, Portugal, and other
Catholic countries. But such was their vitality that, though the order
was abolished by a papal bull in 1773, they have been again restored.</p>



<p><span class="side">Effects of change of opinion among the learned.</span>Though it is sometimes said that Rome in this manner, by her admirable
combinations and irresistible movement, succeeded at last in checking the
Reformation, a full consideration of the state of affairs would lead us
to receive that assertion with very considerable restriction. She came
out of the conflict much less powerful than she had entered it. If <span class="pag">[224]</span> we
<a id="attribute224"></a>attribute to her policy all that it can justly claim, we must also
attribute to causes over which she had no kind of control their rightful
influence. The Reformation had been, to no small extent, due to the rise
of criticism, which still continued its development, and was still
fruitful of results. Latin had fallen from its high estate; the modern
languages were in all directions expanding and improving; the
printing-press was not only giving Greek learning to the world, but
countless translations and commentaries. The doctrine successfully
established by Luther and his colleagues&mdash;the right of private
interpretation and judgment&mdash;was the practical carrying out of the
organic law of criticism to the highest affairs with which man can be
concerned&mdash;affairs of religion. The Reformation itself, philosophically
considered, really meant the casting off of authority, the installation
of individual inquiry and personal opinion.
<span class="side">Effects of criticism on religion and literature.</span>
If criticism, thus standing
upon the basis of the Holy Scriptures, had not hesitated to apply itself
to an examination of public faith, and, as the consequence thereof, had
laid down new rules for morality and the guidance of life, it was not to
be expected that it would hesitate to deal with minor things&mdash;that it
would spare the philosophy, the policy, the literature of antiquity. And
so, indeed, it went on, comparing classical authors with classical
authors, the fathers with the fathers, often the same writer with
himself. Contradictions were pointed out, errors exposed, weakness
detected, and new views offered of almost everything within the range of
literature.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Bible.</span>From this burning ordeal one book alone came out unscathed. It was the
Bible. It spontaneously vindicated for itself what Wiclif in the former
times, and Luther more lately, had claimed for it. And not only did it
hold its ground, but it truly became incalculably more powerful than ever
it had been before. The press multiplied it in every language without
end, until there was scarcely a cottage in reformed Europe that did not
possess a copy.</p>

<p>But if criticism was thus the stimulating principle that had given life
to the Reformation, it had no little to do with its pause; and this is
the influence over which <span class="pag">[225]</span> Rome <a id="had225"></a>had no kind of control, and to which I
have made allusion. The phases through which the Reformation passed were
dependent on the coincident advances of learning. First it relied on the
Scriptures, which were to the last its surest support; then it included
the Fathers.
<span class="side">Decline of the value of patristic learning.</span>
But, from a more intimate study of the latter, many erudite
Protestants were gradually brought back to the ancient fold. Among such
may be mentioned Erasmus, who by degrees became alienated from the
Reformers, and subsequently Grotius, the publication of whose treatise,
"De jure belli et pacis," 1625, really constituted an epoch in the
political system of Europe. This great man had gradually become averse to
the Reformation, believing that, all things considered, it had done more
harm than good; he had concluded that it was better to throw differences
into oblivion for the sake of peace, and to enforce silence on one's own
opinions, rather than to expect that the Church should be compelled to
accommodate herself to them. If such men as Erasmus, Casaubon, and
Grotius had been brought to this dilemma by their profound philosophical
meditations, their conclusion was confirmed among the less reflecting by
the unhappy intolerance of the new as well as the old Church.
<span class="side">Moral effects of persecutions.</span>
Men asked what was the difference between the vindictiveness with which Rome dealt
with Antonio de Dominis, at once an ecclesiastic and a natural
philosopher, who, having gone over to Protestantism and then seceded,
imprudently visited Rome, was there arrested, and dying, his body was dug
up and burnt, and the rigour of Calvin, who seized Servetus, the author
of the "Christianismi Restitutio," and in part the discoverer of the
circulation of the blood, when he happened to pass through Geneva, and
committed him to the flames.</p>


<p><span class="side">End of patristicism.</span>Criticism had thus, in its earlier stage, produced well-marked results.
As it developed it lost none of its power. It had enthroned patristic
theology; now it wrenched from its hand the sceptre. In the works of
Daillé it showed that the fathers are of no kind of use&mdash;they are too
contradictory of one another; even Jeremy Taylor speaks of their
authority and reputation as clean gone for ever. In a few years they had
sunk into <span class="pag">[226]</span> desuetude, a <a id="neglect226"></a>neglect shared by many classical authors, whose
opinions were now only quoted with a respectful smile. The admiration for
antiquity was diminishing under the effect of searching examination.
Books were beginning to appear, turning the old historians into ridicule
for their credulity.
<span class="side">The burning of Servetus by Calvin.</span>
The death of Servetus was not without advantage to
the world. There was not a pious or thoughtful man in all reformed Europe
who was not shocked when the circumstances under which that unhappy
physician had been brought to the stake at Geneva by John Calvin were
made known. For two hours he was roasted in the flames of a slow fire,
begging for the love of God that they would put on more wood, or do
something to end his torture. Men asked, with amazement and indignation,
if the atrocities of the Inquisition were again to be revived. On all
sides they began to inquire how far it is lawful to inflict the
punishment of death for difference of opinion. It opened their eyes to
the fact that, after all they had done, the state of civilization in
which they were living was still characterized by its intolerance. In
1546 the Venetian ambassador at the court of Charles&nbsp;V. reported to his
government that in Holland and Friesland more than thirty thousand
persons had suffered death at the hands of justice for Anabaptist errors.
From such an unpromising state of things toleration could only emerge
with difficulty. It was the offspring, not of charity, but of the checked
animosities of ever-multiplying sects, and the detected impossibility of
their coercing one another.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Reformation continued in America. </span>The history of the Reformation does not close, as many European authors
have imagined, in a balanced and final distribution of the north and
south between the Protestant and the Catholic. The predestined issue of
sectarian differences and dissensions is individual liberty of thought.
So long as there was one vast, overshadowing, intolerant corporation,
every man must bring his understanding to its measure, and think only as
it instructed him to do. As soon as dissenting confessions gathered
sufficient military power to maintain their right of existence&mdash;as soon
as from them, in turn, incessant offshoots were put forth, toleration
became <span class="pag">[227]</span> not <a id="only227"></a>only possible, but inevitable, and that is perhaps as far as
the movement has at this time advanced in Europe. But Macaulay and others
who have treated of the Reformation have taken too limited a view of it,
supposing that this was its point of arrest.
<span class="side">Separation of Church and State. </span>
It made another enormous
stride when, at the American Revolution, the State and the Church were
solemnly and openly dissevered from one another. Now might the
vaticinations of the prophets of evil expect to find credit; a great
people had irrevocably broken off its politics from its theology, and it
might surely have been expected that the unbridled interests, and
instincts, and passions of men would have dragged everything into the
abyss of anarchy. Yet what do we, who are living nearly a century after
that time, find the event to be? Sectarian decomposition, passing forward
to its last extreme, is the process by which individual mental liberty is
engendered and maintained. A grand and imposing religious unity implies
tyranny to the individual; the increasing emergence of sects gives him
increasing latitude of thought&mdash;with their utmost multiplication he gains
his utmost liberty. In this respect, unity and liberty are in opposition;
as the one diminishes, the other increases.
<span class="side">Emergence of liberty of thought.</span>
The Reformation broke down
unity; it gave liberty to masses of men grouped together in sufficient
numbers to insure their position; it is now invisibly, but irresistibly
making steps, never to be stayed until there is an absolute mental
emancipation for man.</p>


<p><span class="side">The American clergy.</span>Great revolutions are not often accomplished without much suffering and
many crimes. It might have been supposed before the event, perhaps it is
supposed by many who are not privileged to live among the last results,
that this decomposition of religious faith must be to the detriment of
personal and practical piety. Yet America, in which, of all countries,
the Reformation at the present moment has farthest advanced, should offer
to thoughtful men much encouragement. Its cities are filled with churches
built by voluntary gifts; its clergy are voluntarily sustained, and are,
in all directions, engaged in enterprises of piety, education, mercy.
What a difference between their private life and that of <span class="pag">[228]</span> ecclesiastics
<a id="before228"></a>before the Reformation! Not, as in the old times, does the layman look
upon them as the cormorants and curse of society; they are his faithful
advisers, his honoured friends, under whose suggestion and supervision
are instituted educational establishments, colleges, hospitals, whatever
can be of benefit to men in this life, or secure for them happiness in
the life to come.</p>

<p><span class="side">Results of the Age of Faith. </span> <span class="pag">[229]</span> Arrived at the commencement of the Age of Reason, we might profitably
examine the social condition of those countries destined to become
conspicuous in the new order of things. I have not space to present such
an examination as extensively as it deserves, and must limit my remarks
to that nation which, of all others, is most interesting to the English
or American reader&mdash;that England which we picture to ourselves as
foremost in civilization, her universities dating back for many
centuries; her charters and laws, on which individual, and therefore
social, liberty rests, spoken of as the ancient privileges of the realm;
her people a clear-headed race, lovers and stout defenders of freedom.
<span class="side">The social condition produced in England.</span>
During by far the greater part of the past period she had been Catholic,
but she had also been Reformed&mdash;ever, as she will always be, religious. A
correct estimate of her national and individual life will point out to us
all that had been done in the Age of Faith. From her condition we may
gather what is the progress made by man <span class="pag">[230]</span> when <a id="guided230"></a>guided by such theological
ideas as those which had been her rule of life.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs convey an instructive lesson. They dissipate
some romantic errors; they are a verdict on a political system from its
practical results. What a contrast with the prodigious advancement made
within a few years when the Age of Reason had set in! How strikingly are
we reminded of the inconsequential, the fruitless actions of youth, and
the deliberate, the durable undertakings of manhood!</p>

<p>For many of the facts I have now to mention the reader will find
authorities in the works of Lord Macaulay and Mr. Froude on English
history. My own reading in other directions satisfies me that the picture
here offered represents the actual condition of things.</p>


<p><span class="side">Condition at the suppression of the monasteries.</span>At the time of the suppression of the monasteries in England the
influences which had been in operation for so many centuries had come to
an end. Had they endured a thousand years longer they could have
accomplished nothing more. The condition of human life shows what their
uses and what their failures had been. There were forests extending over
great districts; fens forty or fifty miles in length, reeking with miasm
and fever, though round the walls of the abbeys there might be beautiful
gardens, green lawns, shady walks, and many murmuring streams. In
trackless woods where men should have been, herds of deer were straying;
the sandy hills were alive with conies, the downs with flocks of
bustards. The peasant's cabin was made of reeds or sticks plastered over
with mud. His fire was chimneyless&mdash;often it was made of peat. In the
objects and manner of his existence he was but a step above the
industrious beaver who was building his dam in the adjacent stream. There
were highwaymen on the roads, pirates on the rivers, vermin in abundance
in the clothing and beds. The common food was peas, vetches, fern roots,
and even the bark of trees. There was no commerce to put off famine. Man
was altogether at the mercy of the seasons. The population, sparse as it
was, was perpetually thinned by pestilence and want. Nor was the state of
the townsman better than that of the rustic; <span class="pag">[231]</span> his <a id="bed231"></a>bed was a bag of straw,
with a hard round log for his pillow. If he was in easy circumstances,
his clothing was of leather, if poor, a wisp of straw wrapped round his
limbs kept off the cold. It was a melancholy social condition when
nothing intervened between reed cabins in the fen, the miserable wigwams
of villages, and the conspicuous walls of the castle and monastery. Well
might they who lived in those times bewail the lot of the ague-stricken
peasant, and point, not without indignation, to the troops of pilgrims,
mendicants, pardoners, and ecclesiastics of every grade who hung round
the Church, to the nightly wassail and rioting drunkenness in the
castle-hall, secure in its moats, its battlements, and its warders. The
local pivots round which society revolved were the red-handed baron,
familiar with scenes of outrage and deeds of blood, and the abbot,
indulging in the extreme of luxury, magnificent in dress, exulting in his
ambling palfrey, his hawk, his hounds. Rural life had but little improved
since the time of Cæsar; in its physical aspect it was altogether
neglected. As to the mechanic, how was it possible that he could exist
where there were no windows made of glass, not even of oiled paper, no
workshop warmed by a fire. For the poor there was no physician, for the
dying the monk and his crucifix. The aim was to smooth the sufferer's
passage to the next world, not to save him for this. Sanitary provisions
there were none except the paternoster and the ave. In the cities the
pestilence walked unstayed, its triumphs numbered by the sounds of the
death-crier in the streets or the knell for the soul that was passing
away.</p>

<p>Our estimate of the influence of the system under which men were thus
living as a regulator of their passions may at this point derive much
exactness from incidents such as those offered by the history of syphilis
and the usages of war. For this purpose we may for a moment glance at the
Continent.</p>


<p><span class="side">Moral state indicated by the spread of syphilis,</span>The attention of all Europe was suddenly arrested by a disease which
broke out soon after the discovery of America. It raged with particular
violence in the French army commanded by Charles&nbsp;VIII. at the siege of
Naples, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1495, and spread <span class="pag">[232]</span> almost <a id="like232"></a>like an epidemic. It was syphilis.
Though there have been medical authors who supposed that it was only an
exacerbation of a malady known from antiquity, that opinion cannot be
maintained after the learned researches of Astruc. That it was something
recognized at the time as altogether new seems to be demonstrated by the
accusations of different nations against each other of having given
origin to it. Very soon, however, the truth appeared. It had been brought
by the sailors of Columbus from the West Indies. Its true character, and
the conditions of its propagation, were fully established by Fernel.</p>

<p>Now, giving full weight to the fact that the virulence of a disease may
be greatest at its first invasion, but remembering that there is nothing
in the history of syphilis that would lead us to suppose it ever was, or
indeed could be infectious, but only contagious, or communicated by
direct contact from person to person; remembering also the special
circumstances under which, in this disease, that contagion is imparted,
the rapidity of its spread all over Europe is a significant illustration
of the fearful immorality of the times. If contemporary authors are to be
trusted, there was not a class, married, or unmarried, clergy or laity,
from the holy father, Leo&nbsp;X., to the beggar by the wayside, free from it.
It swept over Europe, not as Asiatic cholera has done, running along the
great lines of trade, and leaving extensive tracts untouched, settling
upon and devastating great cities here and there, while others had an
immunity. The march of syphilis was equable, unbroken, universal, making
good its ground from its point of appearance in the south-west, steadily
and swiftly taking possession of the entire Continent, and offering an
open manifestation and measure of the secret wickedness of society.</p>


<p><span class="side">and by the usages of war.</span>If thus the sins man practises in privacy became suddenly and
accidentally exposed, that exposure showing how weak is the control that
any system can exercise over human passions, we are brought to the same
melancholy conclusion when we turn to those crimes that may be
perpetrated in the face of day. The usages of war in the civil contests
of <span class="pag">[233]</span> the <a id="fifteenth233"></a>fifteenth century, or in the religious conflicts of the sixteenth
and seventeenth, are perfectly appalling; the annals of those evil days
are full of wanton and objectless barbarities, refusal of quarter, murder
in cold blood, killing of peasants. Invading armies burnt and destroyed
everything in their way; the taking of plunder and ransom of prisoners
were recognized sources of wealth. Prosperous countries were made "a sea
of fire;" the horrible atrocities of the Spaniards in America were
rivalled by those practised in Europe; deliberate directions were given
to make whole tracts "a desert." Attempts had been made to introduce some
amelioration into warfare again and again, either by forbidding
hostilities at certain times, as was the object of the "truces of God,"
repeatedly enforced by ecclesiastical authority, or by establishing
between the combatants themselves courtesies which are at once the chief
grace and glory of chivalry; but, to judge by the result as offered, even
so late as the eighteenth century, those attempts must be regarded as
having proved altogether abortive.</p>


<p><span class="side">Backward condition of England.</span>England, at the close of the Age of Faith, had for long been a chief
pecuniary tributary to Italy, the source from which large revenues had
been drawn, the fruitful field in which herds of Italian ecclesiastics
had been pastured. A wonderful change was impending. At the beginning of
the sixteenth century the island was far more backward intellectually and
politically than is commonly supposed. Its population hardly reached five
millions, and was stationary at that point, not so much because of the
effects of civil and foreign war as merely through the operation of
ordinary economical causes. There was no reason to call more men into
existence. It was regarded as good statesmanship to maintain the
population at a constant standard. The municipal policy corresponded to
the national; it was not so much advanced as that contemporaneously
existing in Peru.
<span class="side">Apparent decline of her prosperity. </span>
Swarms of idle ecclesiastics had set such a pernicious
example that the indisposition among common people to work had become
quite a formidable difficulty. In every village there were stocks for the
punishment <span class="pag">[234]</span> of "<a id="valiant234"></a>valiant beggars," as they were termed. By the act of
1531, vagrants "whole and mighty in body" caught begging for the first
time might be whipped at the cart-tail; the second time their ears were
to be slit; by the act of 1536, if caught the third time they were to be
put to death. In all directions large towns were falling into decay, a
misfortune popularly attributed to the laziness of the lower orders, but
in reality due to causes of a very different kind. Hitherto land had been
the representative of authority and the source of power. Society had been
organized upon that imperfect basis; a descending scale of landed
proprietors had been established, and in that system every man had a
place assigned to him, just as in Peru, though less perfectly. It was a
system of organized labour, the possession of land being a trust, not a
property. But now commerce was beginning to disturb the foundations on
which all these arrangements had been sustained, and to compel a new
distribution of population; trading companies were being established; men
were unsettled by the rumours or realities of immense fortunes rapidly
gained in foreign adventure. Maritime enterprise was thus not only
dislocating society, but even destroying its spirit, substituting
self-interest for loyalty.
<span class="side">It is imputed to the clergy.</span>
 A nation so illiterate that many of its peers
in Parliament could neither read nor write, was hardly able to trace the
troubles befalling it to their proper source; with one voice it imputed
them to the bad example and shortcomings of the clergy. Long before Henry
VIII., England was ready for the suppression of the monasteries. She
regarded them as the very hot-beds of her evils. There were incessant
complaints against the clergy for their scandalous lusts, for personal
impurities such as in modern times we do not allude to, for their holding
livings in plurality, for their extortion of exorbitant profits, and
neglect in the discharge of their duty.
<span class="side">Causes of irritation of the laity against the clergy.</span>
In public opinion, to so great an
extent had these immoralities gone that it was openly asserted that there
were one hundred thousand women in England made dissolute by the clergy.
It was well known that brothels were kept in London for their use. It was
affirmed that the <span class="pag">[235]</span> confessional <a id="was235"></a>was shamefully abused, and, through it,
advantage taken of females; that the vilest crime in an ecclesiastic
might be commuted for money, six shillings and eightpence being
sufficient in the case of mortal sin. Besides these general causes of
complaint, there were some which, though of a minor, were not of a less
irritating kind; such for instance, as the mortuary, soul-shot, or corpse
present, a claim for the last dress worn by persons brought to a priest
for burial, or some exaggerated commutation thereof.</p>


<p><span class="side">Accusation against the clergy by the House of Commons.</span>That such was the demoralized condition of the English Church, and such
its iniquitous relations to the people, we have the most unimpeachable
evidence, under circumstances of an imposing and solemn character. The
House of Commons brought an accusation against the clergy before the
king. When Parliament met <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1529, that House, as its very first act,
declared to the sovereign that sedition and heresy were pervading the
land, and that it had become absolutely necessary to apply a corrective.
It affirmed that the troubles into which the realm had fallen were
attributable to the clergy; that the chief foundation, occasion, and
cause thereof was the parallel jurisdiction of the Church and State; that
the incompatible legislative authority of convocation lay at the bottom
of the mischief. Among other specific points it alleged the
following:&mdash;That the houses of convocation made laws without the royal
assent, and without the consent or even the knowledge of the people; that
such laws were never published in the English language, and that,
nevertheless, men were daily punished under them without ever having had
an opportunity to eschew the penalties; that the demoralization extended
from the Archbishop of Canterbury down to the lowest priest, that
dignitary having tampered with the despatch of justice in his Court of
Arches; that parsons, vicars, priests, and curates were in the habit of
denying the administration of the sacraments save upon the payment of
money; that poor men were harrassed without any legal cause in the
spiritual courts for the mere purpose of extortion, and exorbitant fees
were exacted from them; that the probate of wills was denied <span class="pag">[236]</span> except <a id="on236"></a>on
the gratification of the appetite of prelates and ordinaries for money;
that the high ecclesiastics extorted large sums for the induction of
persons into benefices, and that they did daily confer benefices on
"young folk," their nephews and relatives, being minors, for the purpose
of detaining the fruits and profits in their own hands; that the bishops
illegally imprisoned, sometimes for a year or more, persons in their
jails, without informing them of the cause of their imprisonment or the
name of their accuser; that simple, unlearned men, and even "well-witted"
ones, were entrapped by subtle questions into heresy in the
ecclesiastical courts, and punishment procured against them.</p>

<p>These are serious charges; they imply that the Church had degenerated
into a contrivance for the extortion of money. The House of Commons
petitioned the king to make such laws as should furnish a remedy. The
king submitted the petition to the bishops, and required of them an
answer.</p>


<p><span class="side">Reply of the bishops to that accusation.</span>In that answer the ecclesiastical manner of thought is very striking. The
bishops insist that the laws of the realm shall give way to the canon
law, or, if incompatible, shall be altered so as to suit it; they
identify attacks on themselves with those on the doctrine of the Church,
a time-honoured and well-tried device; they affirm that they have no kind
of enmity against the laymen, "their ghostly children," but only against
the pestilent poison of heresy; that their authority for making laws is
grounded on the Scriptures, to which the laws of the realm must be made
to conform; that they cannot conscientiously permit the king's consent to
the laws, since that would be to put him in the stead of God, under whose
inspiration they are made; that, as to troubling poor men, it is the Holy
Ghost who inspireth them to acts tending to the wealth of his elect folk,
that, if any ecclesiastic hath offended in this respect, though "in
multis offendimus omnes," as St. James hath it, let him bear his own
fault, and let not the whole Church be blamed; that the Protestants,
their antagonists, are lewd, idle fellows, who have embraced the
abominable opinions recently sprung up in Germany; that there are <span class="pag">[237]</span> many
<a id="advantages237"></a>advantages in commuting Church penances and censures for money; that
tithes are a divine institution, and that debts of money owing to God may
be recovered after one hundred or seven hundred years of non-payment,
since God can never lose his rights thereto; that, however, it is not
well to collect a tithe twice over; that priests may lawfully engage in
secular occupations of a certain kind; that the punishments inflicted on
the laymen have been for the health of their souls, and that, generally,
the saints may claim powers to which common men are not entitled.</p>


<p><span class="side">The House passes the Clergy Discipline Act.</span>A fierce struggle between the Commons and the bishops ensued; but the
House was firm, and passed several bills, and among them the Clergy
Discipline Act. The effect was to cut down ecclesiastical incomes,
probate and legacy duties were defined, mortuaries were curtailed,
extortionate fees for burial terminated, clergymen were forbidden to
engage in farming, tanning, brewing, or to buy merchandise for the
purpose of selling it again. It was made unlawful any longer to hold
eight or nine benefices, or to purchase dispensations for not doing duty.
They were compelled to reside in the parishes for the care of which they
were paid, under penalty of £10 a month; and it was made a high penal
offence to obtain dispensations from any of the provisions of this Act
from Rome.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Church is compelled to submit.</span>Nothing could be more significant of the position of the parties than the
high-toned, the conservative moderation of these Acts. The bishops did
not yield, however, without a struggle. In all directions from the
pulpits arose a cry of "atheism," "lack of faith," "heresy." But the
House resolutely stood to its ground. Still more, it sent its speaker to
the king with a complaint against the Bishop of Rochester, who had dared
to stigmatize it as "infidel." The bishop was compelled to equivocate and
apologize.</p>


<p><span class="side">The king is sustained by his people.</span>The English nation and their king were thus together in the suppression
of the monasteries; they were together in the enforcing of ecclesiastical
reforms. It was nothing but this harmony which so quickly brought the
clergy to reason, and induced <span class="pag">[238]</span> them, <a id="in238"></a>in 1532, to anticipate both
Parliament and the people in actually offering to separate themselves
from Rome. In the next year the king had destroyed the vast power which
in so many centuries had gathered round ecclesiastical institutions, and
had forced the clergy into a fitting subordination. Henceforth there was
no prospect that they would monopolize all the influential and lucrative
places in the realm; henceforth, year by year, with many vicissitudes and
changes, their power continued to decline. Their special pursuit,
theology, was separated more and more perfectly from politics. In the
House of Lords, of which they had once constituted one-half, they became
a mere shadow.</p>



<p><span class="side">Religious feeling of the nation changed.</span>Henry&nbsp;VIII. cannot, therefore, be properly considered as the author of
the downfall of ecclesiasticism in England, though he was the instrument
by which it was ostensibly accomplished. The derisive insinuation that
the Gospel light had flashed upon him from Anna Boleyn's eyes was far
from expressing all the truth. The nullity of papal disciplines,
excommunications, interdicts, penances, proved that the old tone of
thought was utterly decayed. This oblivion of old emotions, this
obsoleteness of old things, was by no means confined to England. On the
Continent the attacks of Erasmus on the monks were everywhere received
with applause. In 1527 one printer issued an edition of 24,000 copies of
the Colloquies of Erasmus, and actually sold them all. He understood the
signs of the times.</p>


<p><span class="side">State of England at the close of the seventeenth century.</span>From this digression on parties and policy in England, let us again
return to special details, descending for that purpose to the close of
the seventeenth century. For a long time London had been the most
populous capital in Europe; yet it was dirty, ill built, without sanitary
provisions. The deaths were one in twenty-three each year; now, in a much
more crowded population, they are not one in forty. Much of the country
was still heath, swamp, warren.
<span class="side">Wild state of the country.</span>
Almost within sight of the city was a
tract twenty-five miles round nearly in a state of nature; there were but
three houses in it. Wild animals roamed here and there. It is
incidentally mentioned <span class="pag">[239]</span> that <a id="Queen239"></a>Queen Anne, on a journey to Portsmouth, saw
a herd of five hundred red deer. With such small animals as the marten
and badger, found everywhere, there was still seen occasionally the wild
bull.</p>


<p><span class="side">Locomotion: the roads and carriages.</span>Nothing more strikingly shows the social condition than the provisions
for locomotion. In the rainy seasons the roads were all but impassable,
justifying the epithet often applied to them of being in a horrible
state. Through such gullies, half filled with mud, carriages were
dragged, often by oxen, or, when horses were used, it was as much a
matter of necessity as in the city a matter of display to drive half a
dozen of them. If the country was open the track of the road was easily
mistaken. It was no uncommon thing for persons to lose their way, and
have to spend the night out in the air. Between places of considerable
importance the roads were sometimes very little known, and such was the
difficulty for wheeled carriages that a principal mode of transport was
by pack-horses, of which passengers took advantage, stowing themselves
away between the packs. We shall probably not dissent from their
complaint that this method of travelling was hot in summer and cold in
winter. The usual charge for freight was fifteen pence per ton per mile.
Toward the close of the century what were termed "flying coaches" were
established; they could move at the rate of from thirty to fifty miles in
a day. Many persons thought the risk so great that it was a tempting of
Providence to go in them.
<span class="side">The mails; penny-post disliked.</span>
The mail-bag was carried on horseback at about
five miles an hour. A penny-post had been established in the city, but
with much difficulty, for many long-headed men, who knew very well what
they were saying, had denounced it as an insidious "popish contrivance."</p>

<p>Only a few years before the period under consideration Parliament had
resolved that "all pictures in the royal collection which contained
representations of Jesus or the Virgin Mother should be burnt; Greek
statues were delivered over to Puritan stone-masons to be made decent."
<span class="side">Lewis Muggleton; his doctrines.</span>
A little earlier, Lewis Muggleton had given himself out as the last and
greatest of the prophets, having power to save or damn whom he <span class="pag">[240]</span> pleased.
<a id="It240"></a>It had been revealed to him that God is only six feet high, and the sun
only four miles off. The country beyond the Trent was still in a state of
barbarism, and near the sources of the Tyne there were people scarcely
less savage than American Indians, their "half-naked women chanting a
wild measure, while the men, with brandished dirks, danced a war-dance."</p>


<p><span class="side">Printing-presses and private libraries.</span>
At the beginning of the eighteenth century there were thirty-four
counties without a printer. The only press in England north of the Trent
was at York. As to private libraries, there were none deserving the name.
"An esquire passed for a great scholar if 'Hudibras,' 'Baker's
Chronicle,' 'Tarleton's Jests,' and the 'Seven Champions of Christendom'
lay in his hall-window." It might be expected that the women were
ignorant enough when very few men knew how to write correctly or even
intelligibly, and it had become unnecessary for clergymen to read the
Scriptures in the original tongues.</p>


<p><span class="side">Social discipline; its barbarity.</span>Social discipline was very far from being of that kind which we call
moral. The master whipped his apprentice, the pedagogue his scholar, the
husband his wife. Public punishments partook of the general brutality. It
was a day for the rabble when a culprit was set in the pillory to be
pelted with brickbats, rotten eggs, and dead cats; when women were
fastened by the legs in the stocks at the market-place, or a pilferer
flogged through the town at the cart-tail, a clamour not unfrequently
arising unless the lash were laid on hard enough "to make him howl." In
punishments of higher offenders these whippings were perfectly horrible;
thus Titus Oates, after standing twice in the pillory, was whipped, and,
after an interval of two days, whipped again. A virtuoso in these matters
gives us the incredible information that he counted as many as seventeen
hundred stripes administered. So far from the community
being shocked at such an exhibition, they appeared to agree in the sentiment that, "since
his face could not be made to blush, it was well enough to try what could
be done with his back." Such a hardening of heart was in no little degree
promoted by the atrocious punishments of <span class="pag">[241]</span>  state <a id="offenders241"></a>offenders; thus, after
the decapitation of Montrose and Argyle, their heads decorated the top of
the Tolbooth; and gentlemen, after the rising of Monmouth, were
admonished to be careful of their ways, by hanging in chains to their
park gate the corpse of a rebel to rot in the air.</p>


<p><span class="side">Private life in different classes of society.</span>To a debased public life private life corresponded. The houses of the
rural population were huts covered with straw-thatch; their inmates, if
able to procure fresh meat once a week, were considered to be in
prosperous circumstances. One-half of the families in England could
hardly do that. Children six years old were not unfrequently set to
labour. The lord of the manor spent his time in rustic pursuits; was not
an unwilling associate of pedlars and drovers; knew how to ring a pig or
shoe a horse; his wife and daughters "stitched and spun, brewed
gooseberry wine, cured marigolds, and made the crust for the venison
pasty." Hospitality was displayed in immoderate eating, and drinking of
beer, the guest not being considered as having done justice to the
occasion unless he had gone under the table. The dining-room was
uncarpeted; but then it was tinted with a decoction of "soot and small
beer." The chairs were rush-bottomed. In London the houses were mostly of
wood and plaster, the streets filthy beyond expression. After nightfall a
passenger went at his peril, for chamber windows were opened and
slop-pails unceremoniously emptied down. There were no lamps in the
streets until Master Heming established his public lanterns. As a
necessary consequence, there were plenty of shoplifters, highwaymen, and
burglars.</p>


<p><span class="side">General immorality and brutality. </span>As to the moral condition, it is fearfully expressed in the statement
that men not unfrequently were willing to sacrifice their country for
their religion. Hardly any personage died who was not popularly suspected
to have been made away with by poison, an indication of the morality
generally supposed to prevail among the higher classes. If such was the
state of society in its serious aspect, it was no better in its lighter.
We can scarcely credit the impurity and immodesty of the theatrical
exhibitions. What is said about them would be beyond belief if we did not
remember <span class="pag">[242]</span>  that <a id="they242"></a>they were the amusements of a community whose ideas of
female modesty and female sentiment were altogether different from ours.
Indecent jests were put into the mouths of lively actresses, and the
dancing was not altogether of a kind to meet our approval. The rural
clergy could do but little to withstand this flood of immorality.
<span class="side">Degraded condition of the lower clergy.</span>
Their social position for the last hundred years had been rapidly declining;
for, though the Church possessed among her dignitaries great writers and
great preachers, her lower orders, partly through the political troubles
that had befallen the state, but chiefly in consequence of sectarian
bitterness, had been reduced to a truly menial condition. It was the
business of the rich man's chaplain to add dignity to the dinner-table by
saying grace "in full canonicals," but he was also intended to be a butt
for the mirth of the company. "The young Levite," such was the phrase
then in use, "might fill himself with the corned beef and the carrots,
but as soon as the tarts and cheese-cakes made their appearance he
quitted his seat, and stood aloof till he was summoned to return thanks
for the repast," the daintiest part of which he had not tasted. If need
arose, he could curry a horse, "carry a parcel ten miles," or "cast up
the farrier's bill." The "wages" of a parish priest were at
starvation-point. The social degradation of the ecclesiastic is well
illustrated by an order of Queen Elizabeth, that no clergyman should
presume to marry a servant-girl without the consent of her master or
mistress.</p>

<p>The clergy, however, had not fallen into this condition without in a
measure deserving it. Their time had been too much occupied in
persecuting Puritans and other sectaries, with whom they would have
gladly dealt in the same manner as they had dealt with the Jews, who,
from the thirteenth century till Cromwell, were altogether interdicted
from public worship.
<span class="side">Burning of books and persecution of preachers. </span>
 The University of Oxford had ordered the political
works of Buchanan, Milton, and Baxter to be publicly burnt in the court
of the schools. The immortal vagabond, Bunyan, had been committed to jail
for preaching the way of salvation to the common <span class="pag">[243]</span>  people, <a id="and243"></a>and had
remained there twelve years, the stout old man refusing to give his
promise not to offend in that manner again. The great doctrine inculcated
from the pulpit was submission to temporal power. Men were taught that
rebellion is a sin not less deadly than witchcraft.
<span class="side">The Puritan's hatred of orthodoxy.</span>
On a community
thirsting after the waters of life were still inflicted wearisome sermons
respecting "the wearing of surplices, position at the Eucharist, or the
sign of the cross at baptism," things that were a stench in the nostrils
of the lank-haired Puritan, who, with his hands clasped on his bosom, his
face corrugated with religious astringency, the whites of his eyes turned
upward to heaven, rocking himself alternately on his heels and the tips
of his toes, delivered, in a savoury prayer uttered through his nose, all
such abominations of the Babylonish harlot to the Devil, whose affairs
they were.</p>


<p><span class="side">Brutal administration of the law.</span>In administering the law, whether in relation to political or religious
offences, there was an incredible atrocity. In London, the crazy old
bridge over the Thames was decorated with grinning and mouldering heads
of criminals, under an idea that these ghastly spectacles would fortify
the common people in their resolves to act according to law. The
toleration of the times may be understood from a law enacted by the
Scotch Parliament, May 8, 1685, that whoever preached or heard in a
conventicle should be punished with death and the confiscation of his
goods. That such an infamous spirit did not content itself with mere
dead-letter laws there is too much practical evidence to permit any one
to doubt. A silly labouring man, who had taken it into his head that he
could not conscientiously attend the Episcopal worship, was seized by a
troop of soldiers, "rapidly examined, convicted of non-conformity, and
sentenced to death in the presence of his wife, who led one little child
by the hand, and it was easy to see was about to give birth to another.
He was shot before her face, the widow crying out in her agony, 'Well,
sir, well, the day of reckoning will come.'" Shrieking Scotch Covenanters
were submitted to torture by crushing their knees flat in the boot; women
were tied to stakes on the sea-sands and drowned by the slowly <span class="pag">[244]</span>  advancing
tide <a id="because244"></a>because they would not attend Episcopal worship, or branded on
their cheeks and then shipped to America; gallant but wounded soldiers
were hung in Scotland for fear they should die before they could be got
to England. In the troubles connected with Monmouth's rising, in one
county alone, Somersetshire, two hundred and thirty-three persons were
hanged, drawn and quartered, to say nothing of military executions, for
the soldiers amused themselves by hanging a culprit for each toast they
drank, and making the drums and fifes play, as they said, to his dancing.
It is needless to recall such incidents as the ferocity of Kirk's lambs,
for such was the name popularly given to the soldiers of that colonel, in
allusion to the Paschal lamb they bore on their flag; or the story of Tom
Boilman, so nicknamed from having been compelled by those veterans to
seethe the remains of his quartered friends in melted pitch. Women, for
such idle words as women are always using, were sentenced to be whipped
at the cart's-tail through every market town in Dorset; a lad named
Tutching was condemned to be flogged once a fortnight for seven years.
Eight hundred and forty-one human beings judicially condemned to
transportation to the West India islands, and suffering all the horrible
pains of a slave-ship in the middle passage, "were never suffered to go
on deck;" in the holds below, "all was darkness, stench, lamentation,
disease, and death." One fifth of them were thrown overboard to the
sharks before they reached their destination, and the rest obliged to be
fattened before they could be offered in the market to the Jamaica
planters. The court ladies, and even the Queen of England herself, were
so utterly forgetful of womanly mercy and common humanity as to join in
this infernal traffic. That princess requested that a hundred of the
convicts should be given to her. "The profit which she cleared on the
cargo, after making a large allowance for those who died of hunger and
fever during the passage, cannot be estimated at less than a thousand
guineas."</p>


<p><span class="side">Profligate condition of literature. </span>It remains to add a few words respecting the state of literature. This,
at the end of the seventeenth century, had become indescribably
profligate, and, since the art of reading was by no <span class="pag">[245]</span>  means <a id="generally245"></a>generally
cultivated, the most ready method of literary communication was through
theatrical representation. It was for that reason that play-writing was
the best means of literary remuneration, if we except the profit derived
from the practice which, to some extent, survives, though its disgraceful
motive has ceased, of dedicating books to rich men for the sake of the
fee they would give. It is said that books have actually been printed in
consideration of the profits of the dedication. Especially in the
composition of plays was it judged expedient to minister to the depraved
public taste by indecent expressions, or allusions broad and sly. The
playwright was at the mercy of an audience who were critical on that
point, and in a position, if he should not come up to the required
standard, to damn him and his work in an instant.
<span class="side">Milton's "Paradise Lost."</span>
 From these remarks must
be excepted the writings of Milton, which are nowhere stained by such a
blemish. And yet posterity will perhaps with truth assert that "Paradise
Lost" has wrought more intellectual evil than even its base
contemporaries, since it has familiarized educated minds with images
which, though in one sense sublime, in another are most unworthy, and has
taught the public a dreadful materialization of the great and invisible
God. A Manichean composition in reality, it was mistaken for a Christian
poem.</p>


<p><span class="side">The English theatre.</span>The progress of English literature not only offers striking proofs of the
manner in which it was affected by theatrical representations, but also
furnishes an interesting illustration of that necessary course through
which intellectual development must pass. It is difficult for us, who
live in a reading community, to comprehend the influence once exercised
by the pulpit and the stage in the instruction of a non-reading people.</p>

<p>As late as the sixteenth century they were the only means of mental
access to the public, and we should find, if we were to enter on a
detailed examination of either one or the other, that they furnish a
vivid reflexion of the popular intellectual condition. Leaving to others
such interesting researches into the comparative anatomy of the English
pulpit, I may, for a moment, direct attention to theatrical exhibitions.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its successive phases.</span> <span class="pag">[246]</span>  <a id="There246"></a>There are three obvious phases through which the drama has passed,
corresponding to as many phases in the process of intellectual
development. These are respectively the miracle play, corresponding to
the stage of childhood; the moral, corresponding to that of youth; the
real, corresponding to that of manhood. In them respectively the
supernatural, the theological, the positive predominates. The first went
out of fashion soon after the middle of the fifteenth century, the second
continued for about one hundred and fifty years, the third still remains.
By the miracle play is understood a representation of Scripture
incidents, enacted, however, without any regard to the probabilities of
time, place, or action, such subjects as the Creation, the fall of man,
the Deluge, being considered as suitable, and in these scenes, without
any concern for chronology, other personages, as the Pope or Mohammed,
being introduced, or the Virgin Mary wearing a French hood, or Virgil
worshipping the Saviour. Our forefathers were not at all critical
historians; they indulged without stint in a highly pleasing credulity.
They found no difficulty in admitting that Mohammed was originally a
cardinal, who turned heretic out of spite because he was not elected
Pope; that, since the taking of the true cross by the Turks, all
Christian children have twenty-two instead of thirty-two teeth, as was
the case before that event; and that men have one rib less than women,
answering to that taken from Adam. The moral play personifies virtues,
vices, passions, goodness, courage, honesty, love. The real play
introduces human actors, with a plot free from the supernatural, and
probability is outraged as little as possible. Its excellence consists in
the perfect manner in which it delineates human character and action.</p>


<p><span class="side">Miracle plays, their character.</span>The miracle play was originally introduced by the Church, the first
dramas of the kind, it is said, having been composed by Gregory
Nazianzen. They were brought from Constantinople by the Crusaders; the
Byzantines were always infatuated with theatrical shows. The parts of
these plays were often enacted by ecclesiastics, and not unfrequently the
representations took place at the abbey gate. So highly <span class="pag">[247]</span>  did <a id="the247"></a>the Italian
authorities prize the influence of these exhibitions on the vulgar, that
the pope granted a thousand days of pardon to any person who should
submit to the pleasant penance of attending them. All the arguments that
had been used in behalf of picture-worship were applicable to these
plays; even the Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension were represented.
Over illiterate minds a coarse but congenial influence was obtained; a
recollection, though not an understanding of sacred things. In the play
of "the Fall of Lucifer," that personage was introduced, according to the
vulgar acceptation, with horns, and tail, and cloven hoof; his beard,
however, was red, our forefathers having apparently indulged in a
singular antipathy against hair of that colour. There still remain
accounts of the expenses incurred on some of these occasions, the coarse
quaintness of which is not only amusing, but also shows the debased ideas
of the times. For instance, in "Mysteries," enacted at Coventry, are such
entries as "paid for a pair of gloves for God;" "paid for gilding God's
coat;" "dyvers necessaries for the trimmynge of the Father of Heaven." In
the play of the "Shepherds" there is provision for green cheese and
Halton ale, a suitable recruitment after their long journey to the
birthplace of our Saviour. "Payd to the players for rehearsal: imprimis,
to God, ii<i>s.</i> viii<i>d.</i>; to Pilate his wife, ii<i>s.</i>; item, for keeping
fyer at hell's mouth, iii<i>d.</i>" A strict attention to chronology is not
exacted; Herod swears by Mohammed, and promises one of his councillors to
make him pope. Noah's wife, who, it appears, was a termagant, swears by
the Virgin Mary that she will not go into the ark, and, indeed, is only
constrained so to do by a sound cudgelling administered by the patriarch,
the rustic justice of the audience being particularly directed to the
point that such a flogging should not be given with a stick thicker than
her husband's thumb. The sentiment of modesty seems not to have been very
exacting, since in the play of "the Fall of Man" Adam and Eve appear
entirely naked; one of the chief incidents is the adjustment of the
fig-leaves. Many such circumstances might be related, impressing us
perhaps with an idea of the obscenity and profanity of the times. But
this <span class="pag">[248]</span>  would <a id="scarcely248"></a>scarcely be a just conclusion. As the social state improved,
we begin to find objections raised by the more thoughtful ecclesiastics,
who refused to lend the holy vestments for such purposes, and at last
succeeded in excluding these exhibitions from consecrated places. After
dwindling down by degrees, these plays lingered in the booths at fairs or
on market-days, the Church having resigned them to the guilds of
different trades, and these, in the end, giving them up to the
mountebank. And so they died. Their history is the outward and visible
sign of a popular intellectual condition in process of passing away.</p>


<p><span class="side">Moral plays, their character.</span>The mystery and miracle plays were succeeded by the moral play. It has
been thought by some, who have studied the history of the English
theatre, that these plays were the result of the Reformation, with the
activity of which movement their popularity was coincident. But perhaps
the reader who is impressed with the principle of that definite order of
social advancement so frequently referred to in this book, will agree
with me that this relation of cause and effect can hardly be sustained,
and that devotional exercises and popular recreations are in common
affected by antecedent conditions. Of the moral play, a very
characteristic example still remains under the title of "Everyman," It
often delineates personification and allegory with very considerable
power. This short phase of our theatrical career deserves a far closer
attention than it has hitherto obtained, for it has left an indelible
impression on our literature. I think that it is to this, in its
declining days, that we are indebted for much of the machinery of
Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress." Whoever will compare that work with such
plays as "Everyman" and "Lusty Juventus," cannot fail to be struck with
their resemblances. Such personages as "Good Council," "Abominable
Living," "Hypocrasie," in the play, are of the same family as those in
the Progress. The stout Protestantism of both is at once edifying and
amusing. An utter contempt for "holy stocks and holy stones, holy clouts
and holy bones," as the play has it, animates them all. And it can hardly
be doubted that the immortal tinker, in the carnal days when he played at
tipcat and romped with the girls on the village green <span class="pag">[249]</span>  at <a id="Elstow249"></a>Elstow,
indulged himself in the edification of witnessing these dramatic
representations.</p>


<p><span class="side">Real plays, Shakespeare.</span>As to the passage from this dramatic phase to the real, in which the
character and actions of man are portrayed, to the exclusion or with the
subordination of the supernatural, it is only necessary to allude with
brevity&mdash;indeed, it is only necessary to recall one name, and that one
name is Shakespeare. He stands, in his relations to English literature,
in the same position that the great Greek sculptors stood with respect to
ancient art, embodying conceptions of humanity in its various attributes
with indescribable skill, and with an exquisite agreement to nature.</p>


<p><span class="side">The pulpit and the stage.</span>Not without significance is it that we find mystery in the pulpit and
mystery on the stage. They appertain to social infancy. Such dramas as
those I have alluded to, and many others that, if space had permitted,
might have been quoted, were in unison with the times. The abbeys were
boasting of such treasures as the French hood of the Virgin, "her smocke
or shifte," the manger in which Christ was laid, the spear which pierced
his side, the crown of thorns. The transition from this to the following
stage is not without its political attendants, the prohibition of
interludes containing anything against the Church of Rome, the royal
proclamation against preaching out of one's own brain, the appearance of
the Puritan upon the national stage, an increasing acerbity of habit and
sanctimoniousness of demeanour.</p>

<p>With peculiar facility we may, therefore, through an examination of the
state of the drama, determine national mental condition. The same may be
done by a like examination of the state of the pulpit. Whoever will take
the trouble to compare the results cannot fail to observe how remarkably
they correspond.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the literature of amusement; as to political
literature, even at the close of the period we are considering, it could
not be expected to flourish after the judges had declared that no man
could publish political news except he had been duly authorized by the
crown.
<span class="side">Newspapers and coffee-houses.</span>
Newspapers were, however, beginning to be periodically issued,
and, if <span class="pag">[250]</span>  occasion <a id="called250"></a>called for it,
broadsides, as they were termed were
added. In addition, newsletters were written by enterprising individuals
in the metropolis, and sent to rich persons who subscribed for them; they
then circulated from family to family, and doubtless enjoyed a privilege
which has not descended to their printed contemporary, the newspaper, of
never becoming stale. Their authors compiled them from materials picked
up in the gossip of the coffee-houses. The coffee-houses, in a
non-reading community, were quite an important political as well as
social institution. They were of every kind, prelatical, popish, Puritan,
scientific, literary, Whig, Tory. Whatever a man's notions might be, he
could find in London, in a double sense, a coffee-house to his taste. In
towns of considerable importance the literary demand was insignificant;
thus it is said that the father of Dr. Johnson, the lexicographer,
peddled books from town to town, and was accustomed to open a stall in
Birmingham on market-days, and it is added that this supply of literature
was equal to the demand.</p>


<p><span class="side">Liberty of the press slowly secured.</span>The liberty of the press has been of slow growth. Scarcely had printing
been invented when it was found necessary everywhere to place it under
some restraint, as was, for instance, done by Rome in her "Index
Expurgatorius" of prohibited books, and the putting of printers who had
offended under the ban; the action of the University of Paris, alluded to
<a href="#proposition198">in this volume, p. 198,</a> was essentially of the same kind. In England, at
first, the press was subjected to the common law; the crown judges
themselves determined the offence, and could punish the offender with
fine, imprisonment, or even death. Within the last century this power of
determination has been taken from them, and a jury must decide, not only
on the fact, but also on the character of the publication, whether
libellous, seditious, or otherwise offensive.
<span class="side">Its present condition.</span>
 The press thus came to be a
reflector of public opinion, casting light back upon the public; yet as
with other reflectors, a portion of the illuminating power is lost. The
restraints under which it is laid are due, not so much to the fear that
liberty will degenerate into license, for public opinion would soon
correct that; <span class="pag">[251]</span>  they <a id="are251"></a>are rather connected with the necessities of the
social state.</p>


<p><span class="side">Contrast between progress in the ages of Faith and Reason.</span>Whoever will examine the condition of England at successive periods
during her passage through the Age of Faith will see how slow was her
progress, and will, perhaps, be surprised to find at its close how small
was her advance. The ideas that had served her for so many centuries as a
guide had rather obstructed than facilitated her way. But whoever will
consider what she has done since she fairly entered on her Age of Reason
will remark a wonderful contrast. There has not been a progress in
physical conditions only&mdash;a securing of better food, better clothing,
better shelter, swifter locomotion, the procurement of individual
happiness, an extension of the term of life. There has been a great moral
advancement. Such atrocities as those mentioned in the foregoing
paragraphs are now impossible, and so unlike our own manners that
doubtless we read of them at first with incredulity, and with difficulty
are brought to believe that these are the things our ancestors did. What
a difference between the dilatoriness of the past, its objectless
exertions, its unsatisfactory end, and the energy, and well-directed
intentions of the present age, which have already yielded results like
the prodigies of romance.</p>

<p><span class="side">An astronomical problem.</span> <span class="pag">[252]</span> The Age of Reason in Europe was ushered in by an astronomical
controversy.</p>

<p>Is the earth the greatest and most noble body in the universe, around
which, as an immovable centre, the sun, and the various planets, and
stars revolve, ministering by their light and other qualities to the
wants and pleasures of man, or is it an insignificant orb&mdash;a mere
point&mdash;submissively revolving, among a crowd of compeers and superiors,
around a central sun? The former of these views was authoritatively
asserted by the Church; the latter, timidly suggested by a few thoughtful
and religious men at first, in the end gathered strength, and carried the
day.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its important consequences.</span> <span class="pag">[253]</span>  <a id="Behind253"></a>Behind this physical question&mdash;a mere scientific problem&mdash;lay something
of the utmost importance&mdash;the position of man in the universe. The
conflict broke out upon an ostensible issue, but every one saw what was
the real point in the dispute.</p>


<p><span class="side">Treatment of the Age of Reason.</span>In the history of the Age of Reason in Europe, which is to fill the
remaining pages of this book, I am constrained to commence with this
astronomical controversy, and have therefore been led by that
circumstance to complete the survey of the entire period from the same,
that is, the scientific point of view. Many different modes of treating
it spontaneously present themselves; but so vast are the subjects to be
brought under consideration, so numerous their connexions, and so limited
the space at my disposal, that I must give the preference to one which,
with sufficient copiousness, offers also precision. Whoever will examine
the progress of European intellectual advancement thus far manifested
will find that it has concerned itself with three great questions: 1. The
ascertainment of the position of the earth in the universe; 2. The
history of the earth in time; 3. The position of man among living beings.
Under this last is ranged all that he has done in scientific discovery,
and all those inventions which are the characteristics of the present
industrial age.</p>

<p>What am I? Where am I? we may imagine to have been the first exclamations
of the first man awakening to conscious existence. Here, in our Age of
Reason, we have been dealing with the same thoughts. They are the same
which, as we have seen, occupied Greek intellectual life.</p>


<p><span class="side">Roman astronomical ideas.</span>When Halley's comet appeared in 1456, it was described by those who saw
it as an object of "unheard-of magnitude;" its tail, which shook down
"diseases, pestilence, and war" upon earth, reached over a third part of
the heavens. It was considered as connected with the progress of Mohammed
II., who had just then taken Constantinople. It struck terror into all
people. From his seat, invisible to it, in Italy, the sovereign pontiff,
Calixtus&nbsp;III., issued his ecclesiastical fulminations; but the comet in
the heavens, like the sultan <span class="pag">[254]</span>  on <a id="the254"></a>the earth, pursued its course
undeterred. In vain were all the bells in Europe ordered to be rung to
scare it away; in vain was it anathematized; in vain were prayers put up
in all directions to stop it. True to its time, it punctually returns
from the abysses of space, uninfluenced by anything save agencies of a
material kind. A signal lesson for the meditations of every religious
man.</p>


<p><span class="side">More correct ideas among some of the clergy.</span>Among the clergy there were, however, some who had more correct cosmic
ideas than those of Calixtus. A century before Copernicus, Cardinal de
Cusa had partially adopted the heliocentric theory, as taught in the old
times by Philolaus, Pythagoras, and Archimedes. He ascribed to the earth
a globular form, rotation on its axis, and a movement in space; he
believed that it moves round the sun, and both together round the pole of
the universe.</p>


<p><span class="side">The geocentric and heliocentric theories.</span>By geocentric theory is meant that doctrine which asserts the earth to be
the immovable centre of the universe; by heliocentric theory that which
demonstrates the sun to be the centre of our planetary system, implying,
as a necessary influence, that the earth is a very small and subordinate
body revolving round the sun.</p>


<p><span class="side">The geocentric doctrine adopted by the Church.</span>I have already, in sufficient detail, described how the Roman Church had
been constrained by her position to uphold the geocentric doctrine. She
had come to regard it as absolutely essential to her system, the
intellectual basis of which she held would be sapped if this doctrine
should be undermined. Hence it was that such an alarm was shown at the
assertion of the globular form of the earth, and hence the surpassing
importance of the successful voyage of Magellan's ship. That indisputable
demonstration of the globular figure was ever a solid support to the
scientific party in the portentous approaching conflict.</p>


<p><span class="side">Preparations for the heliocentric doctrine.</span>Preparations had been silently making for a scientific revolution in
various directions. The five memoirs of Cardinal Alliacus "On the
Concordance of Astronomy with Theology," show the turn that thought was
taking. His "Imago Mundi" was published in 1460, and is said to have <span class="pag">[255]</span>  been
a <a id="favourite255"></a>favourite work with Columbus. In the very Cathedral of Florence,
Toscanelli had constructed his celebrated gnomon, 1468, a sun-ray,
auspicious omen! being admitted through a plate of brass in the lantern
of the cupola. John Muller, better known as Regiomontanus, had published
an abridgment of Ptolemy's "Almagest," 1520. Euclid had been printed with
diagrams on copper as long before as 1482, and again in Venice
twenty-three years subsequently. The Optics of Vitello had been published
1533. Fernel, physician to Henry&nbsp;II. of France, had even ventured so far,
supported by Magellan's voyage, as to measure, 1527, the size of the
earth, his method being to observe the height of the pole at Paris, then
to proceed northward until its elevation was increased exactly one
degree, and to ascertain the distance between the stations by the number
of revolutions of his carriage wheel. He concluded that it is 24,480
Italian miles round the globe. The last attempt of the kind had been that
of the Khalif Almaimon seven hundred years previously on the shore of the
Red Sea, and with nearly the same result. The mathematical sciences were
undergoing rapid advancement. Rhæticus had published his trigonometrical
tables; Cardan, Tartaglia, Scipio Ferreo, and Stefel were greatly
improving algebra.</p>


<p><span class="side">Copernicus, the works of.</span>The first formal assertion of the heliocentric theory was made in a timid
manner, strikingly illustrative of the expected opposition. It was by
Copernicus, a Prussian, speaking of the revolutions of the heavenly
bodies; the year was about 1536. In his preface, addressed to Pope Paul&nbsp;III.,
 whether written by himself, or, as some have affirmed, for him by
Andreas Osiander, he complains of the imperfections of the existing
system, states that he has sought among ancient writers for a better way,
and so had learned the heliocentric doctrine. "Then I too began to
meditate on the motion of the earth, and, though it appeared an absurd
opinion, yet since I knew that in previous times others had been allowed
the privilege of feigning what circles they chose in order to explain the
phenomena, I conceived that I might take the liberty of trying whether,
on the supposition of the earth's motion, it was possible to find <span class="pag">[256]</span>  better
<a id="explanations256"></a>explanations than the ancient ones of the revolutions of the celestial
orbs."</p>

<p>"Having, then, assumed the motions of the earth, which are hereafter
explained, by laborious and long observation I at length found that, if
the motions of the other planets be compared with the revolution of the
earth, not only their phenomena follow from the suppositions, but also
that the several orbs and the whole system are so connected in order and
magnitude that no one point can be transposed without disturbing the
rest, and introducing confusion into the whole universe."</p>


<p><span class="side">Introduction of his system.</span>The apologetic air with which he thus introduces his doctrine is again
remarked in his statement that he had kept his book for thirty-six years,
and only now published it at the entreaty of Cardinal Schomberg. The
cardinal had begged of him a manuscript copy. "Though I know that the
thoughts of a philosopher do not depend on the judgment of the many, his
study being to seek out truth in all things as far as is permitted by God
to human reason, yet, when I considered how absurd my doctrine would
appear, I long hesitated whether I should publish my book, or whether it
were not better to follow the example of the Pythagoreans and others, who
delivered their doctrine only by tradition and to friends."
<span class="side"> He fears being accused of heresy.</span>
He concludes: "If there be vain babblers who, knowing nothing of mathematics, yet
assume the right of judging on account of some place of Scripture
perversely wrested to their purpose, and who blame and attack my
undertaking, I heed them not, and look upon their judgments as rash and
contemptible."</p>

<p>Copernicus clearly recognized not only the relative position of the
earth, but also her relative magnitude. He says the magnitude of the
world is so great that the distance of the earth from the sun has no
apparent magnitude when compared with the sphere of the fixed stars.</p>


<p><span class="side">Early correction of the Copernican theory.</span>To the earth Copernicus attributed a triple motion&mdash;a daily rotation on
her axis, an annual motion round the sun, a motion of declination of the
axis. The latter seemed to be necessary to account for the constant
direction of the pole; but as this was soon found to be a misconception,
<span class="pag">[257]</span>  the <a id="theory257"></a>theory was relieved of it. With this correction, the doctrine of
Copernicus presents a clear and great advance, though in the state in
which he offered it he was obliged to retain the mechanism of epicycles
and eccentrics, because he considered the planetary motions to be
circular. It was the notion that, since the circle is the most simple of
all geometrical forms, it must therefore be the most natural, which led
to this imperfection. His work was published in 1543. He died a few days
after he had seen a copy.</p>

<p>Against the opposition it had to encounter, the heliocentric theory made
its way slowly at first. Among those who did adopt it were some whose
connexion served rather to retard its progress, because of the ultraism
of their views, or the doubtfulness of their social position.
<span class="side">Giordano Bruno of Nola.</span>
Such was
Bruno, who contributed largely to its introduction into England, and who
was the author of a work on the Plurality of Worlds, and of the
conception that every star is a sun, having opaque planets revolving
round it&mdash;a conception to which the Copernican system suggestively leads.
Bruno was born seven years after the death of Copernicus. He became a
Dominican, but, like so many other thoughtful men of the times, was led
into heresy on the doctrine of transubstantiation. Not concealing his
opinions, he was persecuted, fled, and led a vagabond life in foreign
countries, testifying that wherever he went he found scepticism under the
polish of hypocrisy, and that he fought not against the belief of men,
but against their pretended belief.
<span class="side">He teaches the heliocentric theory,</span>
 For teaching the rotation of the
earth he had to flee to Switzerland, and thence to England, where, at
Oxford, he gave lectures on cosmology. Driven from England, France, and
Germany in succession, he ventured in his extremity to return to Italy,
and was arrested in Venice, where he was kept in prison in the Piombi for
six years without books, or paper, or friends. Meantime the Inquisition
demanded him as having written heretical works. He was therefore
surrendered to Rome, and, after a farther imprisonment of two years,
tried, excommunicated, and delivered over to the secular authorities, to
be punished "as mercifully as possible, and without the shedding of <span class="pag">[258]</span>  his
<a id="blood258"></a>blood," the abominable formula for burning a man alive. He had collected
all the observations that had been made respecting the new star in
Cassiopeia, 1572; he had taught that space is infinite, and that it is
filled with self-luminous and opaque worlds, many of them inhabited&mdash;this
being his capital offence. He believed that the world is animated by an
intelligent soul, the cause of forms but not of matter; that it lives in
all things, even such as seem not to live; that every thing is ready to
become organized; that matter is the mother of forms and then their
grave; that matter and the soul of the world together constitute God. His
ideas were therefore pantheistic, "Est Deus in nobis." In his "Cena de le
Cenere" he insists that the Scripture was not intended to teach science,
but morals only. The severity with which he was treated was provoked by
his asseverations that he was struggling with an orthodoxy that had
neither morality nor belief. This was the aim of his work entitled "The
triumphant Beast."
<span class="side">and is burnt alive as a heretic.</span>
 He was burnt at Rome, February 16, 1600. With both a
present and prophetic truth, he nobly responded, when the atrocious
sentence was passed upon him, "Perhaps it is with greater fear that ye
pass this sentence upon me than I receive it." His tormentors jocosely
observed, as the flames shut him out forever from view, that he had gone
to the imaginary worlds he had so wickedly feigned.</p>

<p>This vigorous but spasmodic determination of the Church to defend herself
was not without effect. It enabled her to hold fast the timid, the
time-servers, the superficial.
<span class="side">Lord Bacon. Rejects the Copernican doctrine.</span>
Among such may be mentioned Lord Bacon,
who never received the Copernican system. With the audacity of ignorance,
he presumed to criticize what he did not understand, and, with a superb
conceit, disparaged the great Copernicus. He says, "In the system of
Copernicus there are many and grave difficulties; for the threefold
motion with which he encumbers the earth is a serious inconvenience, and
the separation of the sun from the planets, with which he has so many
affections in common, is likewise a harsh step; and the introduction of
so many immovable bodies in nature, as when he makes the sun and stars
<span class="pag">[259]</span>  immovable, <a id="the259"></a>the bodies which are peculiarly lucid and radiant, and his
making the moon adhere to the earth in a sort of epicycle, and some other
things which he assumes, are proceedings which mark a man who thinks
nothing of introducing fictions of any kind into nature, provided his
calculations turn out well." The more closely we examine the writings of
Lord Bacon, the more unworthy does he seem to have been of the great
reputation which has been awarded to him. The popular delusion to which
he owes so much originated at a time when the history of science was
unknown. They who first brought him into notice knew nothing of the old
school of Alexandria. This boasted founder of a new philosophy could not
comprehend, and would not accept, the greatest of all scientific
doctrines when it was plainly set before his eyes.</p>

<p>It has been represented that the invention of the true method of physical
science was an amusement of Bacon's hours of relaxation from the more
laborious studies of law and duties of a court. His chief admirers have
been persons of a literary turn, who have an idea that scientific
discoveries are accomplished by a mechanico-mental operation.
<span class="side">The practical uselessness of his philosophy.</span>
Bacon never
produced any great practical result himself, no great physicist has ever
made any use of his method. He has had the same to do with the
development of modern science that the inventor of the orrery has had to
do with the discovery of the mechanism of the world. Of all the important
physical discoveries, there is not one which shows that its author made
it by the Baconian instrument. Newton never seems to have been aware that
he was under any obligation to Bacon. Archimedes, and the Alexandrians,
and the Arabians, and Leonardo da Vinci did very well before he was born;
the discovery of America by Columbus and the circumnavigation by Magellan
can hardly be attributed to him, yet they were the consequences of a
truly philosophical reasoning. But the investigation of nature is an
affair of genius, not of rules. No man can invent an organon for writing
tragedies and Epic poems. Bacon's system is, in it own terms, an idol of
the theatre. It would scarcely guide a man to a solution of the riddle of
Ælia Lælia Crispis, or to that of the charade of Sir Hilary.</p>


<p><span class="side">His scientific errors.</span> <span class="pag">[260]</span>   <a id="Few260"></a>Few
scientific pretenders have made more mistakes than Lord Bacon. He
rejected the Copernican system, and spoke insolently of its great author;
he undertook to criticise adversely Gilbert's treatise "De Magnete;" he
was occupied in the condemnation of any investigation of final causes,
while Harvey was deducing the circulation of the blood from
Aquapendente's discovery of the valves in the veins; he was doubtful
whether instruments were of any advantage, while Galileo was
investigating the heavens with the telescope. Ignorant himself of every
branch of mathematics, he presumed that they were useless in science, but
a few years before Newton achieved by their aid his immortal discoveries.
It is time that the sacred name of philosophy should be severed from its
long connexion with that of one who was a pretender in science, a
time-serving politician, an insidious lawyer, a corrupt judge, a
treacherous friend, a bad man.</p>


<p><span class="side">Adoption of the Copernican doctrine.</span>But others were not so obtuse as Bacon. Gilbert, one of the best of the
early English experimentalists, an excellent writer on magnetism, adopted
the views of Copernicus. Milton, in "Paradise Lost," set forth in
language such as he only could use the objections to the Ptolemaic, and
the probabilities of the Copernican system. Some of the more liberal
ecclesiastics gave their adhesion. Bishop Wilkins not only presented it
in a very popular way, but also made some sensible suggestions
explanatory of the supposed contradictions of the new theory to the Holy
Scriptures. It was, however, among geometricians, as Napier, Briggs,
Horrox, that it met with its best support. On the continent the doctrine
was daily making converts, and nightly gathering strength from the
accordance of the tables of the motions of the heavenly bodies calculated
upon its principles with actual observation.</p>


<p><span class="side">Invention of the telescope.</span>It is by no means uninteresting to notice the different classes of men
among whom this great theory was steadily winning its way. Experimental
philosophers, Republican poets, Episcopal clergymen, Scotch lords, West
of England schoolmasters, Italian physicists, Polish pedants, painstaking
Germans, each from his own special point of view, was gradually receiving
the light, and doubtless, <span class="pag">[261]</span>  from <a id="such261"></a>such varied influence, the doctrine would
have vindicated its supremacy at last, though it might have taken a long
time. On a sudden, however, there occurred a fortunate event, which led
forthwith to that result by a new train of evidence, bringing the matter,
under the most brilliant circumstances, clearly to the apprehension of
every one. This great and fortunate event was the invention of the
telescope.</p>


<p><span class="side">Galileo constructs one.</span>It is needless to enter on any examination of the authorship of this
invention. It is enough for our purpose to know that Lippershey, a
Dutchman, had made one toward the close of 1608, and that Galileo,
hearing of the circumstance, but without knowing the particulars of the
construction, in April or May of the following year invented a form of it
for himself. Not content with admiring how close and large it made
terrestrial objects, he employed it for examining the heavens.
<span class="side">Telescopic astronomical discoveries.</span>
 On turning
it to the moon, he found that she has mountains casting shadows, and
valleys like those of the earth. The discovery of innumerable fixed
stars&mdash;not fewer than forty were counted by him in the well-known group
of the Pleiades&mdash;up to that time unseen by man, was felt at once to offer
an insuperable argument against the opinion that these bodies were
created only to illuminate the night; indeed, it may be said that this
was a death-blow to the time-honoured doctrine of the human destiny of
the universe. Already Galileo began to encounter vulgar indignation,
which accused him loudly of impiety. On January 7th, 1610, he discovered
three of Jupiter's satellites, and a few days later the fourth. To these
he gave the designation of the Medicean stars, and in his "Sidereal
Messenger" published an account of the facts he had thus far observed. As
it was perceived at once that this planet offered a miniature
representation of the ideas of Copernicus respecting the solar system,
this discovery was received by the astronomical party with the liveliest
pleasure, by the ecclesiastical with the most bitter opposition, some
declaring that it was a mere optical deception, some a purposed fraud,
some that it was sheer blasphemy, and some, fairly carrying out to its
consequences the absurd philosophy of the day, asserted that, since <span class="pag">[262]</span>  the
<a id="pretended262"></a>pretended satellites were invisible to the naked eye, they must be
useless, and, being useless, they could not exist. Continuing his
observations, Galileo found that Saturn differs in an extraordinary
manner from other planets; but the telescope he used not being sufficient
to demonstrate the ring, he fell into the mistake that the body of the
planet is triple. This was soon followed by the discovery of the phases
of Venus, which indisputably established for her a motion round the sun,
and actually converted what had hitherto, on all hands, been regarded as
one of the weightiest objections against the Copernican theory, into a
most solid support. "If the doctrine of Copernicus be true, the planet
Venus ought to show phases like the moon, which is not the case;" so said
the objectors. Copernicus himself saw the difficulty, and tried to remove
it by suggesting that the planet might be transparent. The telescope of
Galileo for ever settled the question by showing that the expected phases
do actually exist.</p>


<p><span class="side">Commencing opposition to Galileo.</span>In the garden of Cardinal Bandini at Rome, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1611, Galileo publicly
exhibited the spots upon the sun. He had observed them the preceding
year. Goaded on by the opposition his astronomical discoveries were
bringing upon him, he addressed a letter in 1613 to the Abbe Castelli,
for the purpose of showing that the Scriptures were not intended as a
scientific authority. This was repeating Bruno's offence. Hereupon the
Dominicans, taking alarm, commenced to attack him from their pulpits. It
shows how reluctantly, and with what misgivings the higher ecclesiastics
entered upon the quarrel, that Maraffi, the general of the Dominicans,
apologized to Galileo for what had taken place. The astronomer now
published another letter reiterating his former opinions, asserting that
the Scriptures were only intended for our salvation, and otherwise
defending himself, and recalling the fact that Copernicus had dedicated
his book to Pope Paul&nbsp;III.</p>


<p><span class="side">He is summoned to Rome.</span>
Through the suggestion of the Dominicans, Galileo was now summoned to
Rome to account for his conduct and opinions before the Inquisition. He
was accused of having taught that the earth moves; that the sun is
stationary; and of having attempted <span class="pag">[263]</span>  to <a id="reconcile263"></a>reconcile these doctrines with
the Scriptures. The sentence was that he must renounce these heretical
opinions, and pledge himself that he would neither publish nor defend
them for the future.
<span class="side">Is condemned by the Inquisition,</span>
In the event of his refusal he was to be imprisoned.
With the fate of Bruno in his recollection, he assented to the required
recantation, and gave the promise demanded. The Inquisition then
proceeded to deal with the Copernican system, condemning it as heretical;
the letters of Galileo, which had given rise to the trouble, were
prohibited; also Kepler's epitome of the Copernican theory, and also the
work of Copernicus.
<span class="side">which condemns the Copernican system.</span>
In their decree prohibiting this work "De
Revolutionibus," the Congregation of the Index, March 5, 1616, denounced
the new system of the universe as "that false Pythagorean doctrine
utterly contrary to the Holy Scriptures."</p>

<p>Again  it appears how reluctant the Roman authorities were to interfere,
and how they were impelled rather by the necessity of their position than
by their personal belief in the course they had been obliged to take.
<span class="side">The personal sentiments of the Popes.</span>
After all that had passed, the Pope, Paul&nbsp;V., admitted Galileo to an
audience, at which he professed to him personally the kindest sentiments,
and assured him of safety. When Urban&nbsp;VIII. succeeded to the pontifical
chair, Galileo received the distinction of not less than six audiences;
the Pope conferred on him several presents, and added the promise of a
pension for his son. In a letter to the Duke of Florence his Holiness
used the most liberal language, stated how dear to him Galileo was, that
he had very lovingly embraced him, and requested the duke to show him
every favour.</p>


<p><span class="side">Galileo publishes "The System of the World."</span>Whether it was that, under these auspicious circumstances, Galileo
believed he could with impunity break through the engagement he had made,
or whether an instinctive hatred of that intellectual despotism and
hypocrisy which was weighing upon Europe became irrepressible in his
breast, in 1632 he ventured on the publication of his work, entitled "The
System of the World," its object being to establish the truth of the
Copernican doctrine. It is <span class="pag">[264]</span>  composed <a id="in264"></a>in the dialogue form, three speakers
being introduced, two of them true philosophers, the third an objector.
Whatever may have been the personal opinion of the Pope, there can be no
doubt that his duty rendered it necessary for him to act. Galileo was
therefore again summoned before the Inquisition, the Tuscan ambassador
expostulating against the inhumanity of thus dealing with an old man in
ill health. But no such considerations were listened to, and Galileo was
compelled to appear at Rome, February, 1633, and surrender himself to the
Holy Office. The Pope's nephew did all in his power to meet the necessity
of the Church and yet to spare the dignity of science. He paid every
attention to the personal comfort of the accused. When the time came for
Galileo to be put into solitary confinement, he endeavoured to render the
imprisonment as light as possible; but, finding it to prey upon the
spirits of the aged philosopher, he, on his own responsibility, liberated
him, permitting him to reside in the house of the Tuscan ambassador.
<span class="side">Is again condemned by the Inquisition.</span>
The trial being completed, Galileo was directed to appear, on June 22nd, to
hear his sentence. Clothed in the penitential garment, he received
judgment. His heretical offences were specified, the pledges he had
violated recited; he was declared to have brought upon himself strong
suspicions of heresy, and to be liable to the penalties thereof; but from
these he might be absolved if, with a sincere heart, he would abjure and
curse his heresies. However, that his offences might not altogether go
unpunished, and that he might be a warning to others, he was condemned to
imprisonment during the pleasure of the Inquisition, his dialogues were
prohibited by public edict, and for three years he was directed to
recite, once a week, the seven penitential psalms.</p>


<p><span class="side">His degradation and punishment.</span>In his garment of disgrace the aged philosopher was now made to fall upon
his knees before the assembled cardinals, and, with his hand on the
Gospels, to make the required abjuration of the heliocentric doctrine,
and to give the pledges demanded. He was then committed to the prison of
the Inquisition; the persons who had been concerned in the printing of
his book were punished; and the sentence and abjuration <span class="pag">[265]</span>  were <a id="formally265"></a>formally
promulgated, and ordered to be publicly read in the universities. In
Florence, the adherents of Galileo were ordered to attend in the Church
of Santa Croce to witness his disgrace. After a short imprisonment in the
jail of the Inquisition, he was ordered to Arcetri, and confined in his
own house. Here severe misfortunes awaited him; his favourite daughter
died; he fell into a state of melancholy; an application that he might go
to Florence for the sake of medical advice was refused. It became evident
that there was an intention to treat him with inexorable severity. After
five years of confinement, permission was reluctantly accorded to him to
remove to Florence for his health; but still he was forbidden to leave
his house, or receive his friends, or even to attend mass during Passion
Week without a special order. The Grand-duke tried to abate this
excessive severity, directing his ambassador at the court of Rome to
plead the venerable age and ill health of the immortal convict, and that
it was desirable to permit him to communicate certain scientific
discoveries he had made to some other person, such as Father Castelli.
Not even that was accorded unless the interview took place in the
presence of an official of the Inquisition. Soon after Galileo was
remanded to Arcetri. He spent the weary hours in composing his work on
Local Motion, his friends causing it to be surreptitiously published in
Holland.
<span class="side">The calamities of his old age.</span>
 His infirmities and misfortunes now increased. In 1637 he became
totally blind. In a letter he plaintively says, referring to this
calamity, "So it pleases God, it shall therefore please me also." The
exquisite refinement of ecclesiastical vengeance pursued him
remorselessly, and now gave him permission to see his friends when sight
was no longer possible. It was at this period that an illustrious
stranger, the author of "Paradise Lost," visited him. Shortly after he
became totally deaf; but to the last he occupied himself with
investigations respecting the force of percussion.
<span class="side">His death; is refused burial.</span>
He died, January, 1642, in the seventy-eighth year of his age, the prisoner of the
Inquisition. True to its instincts, that infernal institution followed
him beyond the grave, disputing his right to make a will, and denying him
burial in <span class="pag">[266]</span>  consecrated <a id="ground266"></a>ground. The pope also prohibited his friends from
raising to him a monument in the church of Santa Croce, in Florence. It
was reserved for the nineteenth century to erect a suitable memorial in
his honour.</p>


<p><span class="side">Steady advance of the Copernican system.</span>The result of the discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo was thus to bring
the earth to her real position of subordination and to give sublimer
views of the universe. M&oelig;stlin expresses correctly the state of the
case when he says, "What is the earth and the ambient air with respect to
the immensity of space? It is a point, a punctule, or something, if there
be any thing, less." It had been brought down to the condition of one of
the members of a family&mdash;the solar system. And since it could be no
longer regarded as holding all other bodies in submissive attendance upon
it, dominating over their movements, there was reason to suppose that it
would be found to maintain interconnexions with them in the attitude of
an equal or subordinate; in other words, that general relations would be
discovered expressive of the manner in which all the planetary members of
the solar system sustain their movements round the sun.</p>



<p><span class="side">Kepler, his mode of inquiry.</span>Among those whose minds were thoroughly occupied with this idea, Kepler
stands pre-eminently conspicuous. It is not at all surprising,
considering the tone of thought of those times, that he regarded his
subject with a certain mysticism. They who condemn his manner of thus
viewing things do not duly appreciate the mental condition of the
generation in which he lived. Whatever may be said on that point, no one
can deny him a marvellous patience, and almost superhuman painstaking
disposition. Guess after guess, hypothesis after hypothesis, he submitted
to computations of infinite labour, and doubtless he speaks the
melancholy truth when he says, "I considered and reflected till I was
almost mad." Yet, in the midst of repeated disappointment, he held, with
a truly philosophical determination, firmly to the belief that there must
be some physical interconnexion among the parts of the solar system, and
that it would certainly be displayed by the discovery of laws presiding
over the distances, times, and velocities <span class="pag">[267]</span>  of <a id="the267"></a>the planets. In these
speculations he was immersed before the publications of Galileo. In his
"Mysterium Cosmographicum" he says, "In the year 1595 I was brooding with
the whole energy of my mind on the subject of the Copernican system."</p>



<p><span class="side">Discovery of Kepler's laws.</span>In 1609 he published his work entitled "On the Motion of Mars." This was
the result of an attempt, upon which he had been engaged since the
beginning of the century, to reconcile the motions of that planet to the
hypothesis of eccentrics and epicycles. It ended in the abandonment of
that hypothesis, and in the discovery of the two great laws now known as
the first and second laws of Kepler. They are respectively that the
orbits of the planets are elliptical, and that the areas described by a
line drawn from the planet to the sun are proportional to the times.</p>

<p>In 1617 he was again rewarded by the discovery which passes under the
designation of Kepler's third law: it expresses the relation of the mean
distances of the planets from the sun with the times of their
revolutions&mdash;"the squares of the periodic times are in the same
proportion as the cubes of the distances." In his "Epitome of the
Copernican Astronomy," published 1622, he showed that this law likewise
holds good for the satellites of Jupiter as regards their primary.</p>


<p><span class="side">His remonstrance with the Church.</span>Humboldt, referring to the movement of Jupiter's satellites, remarks: "It
was this which led Kepler, in his 'Harmonices Mundi,' to state, with the
firm confidence and security of a German spirit of philosophical
independence, to those whose opinions bore sway beyond the Alps, 'Eighty
years have elapsed during which the doctrines of Copernicus regarding the
movement of the earth and the immobility of the sun have been promulgated
without hindrance, because it was deemed allowable to dispute concerning
natural things and to elucidate the works of God, and, now that new
testimony is discovered in proof of the truth of those
doctrines&mdash;testimony which was not known to the spiritual judges, ye
would prohibit the promulgation of the true system of the structure of
the universe.'"</p>


<p><span class="side">Rectification of the Copernican theory.</span>Thus we see that the heliocentric theory, as proposed <span class="pag">[268]</span>  by <a id="Copernicus268"></a>Copernicus, was
undergoing rectification. The circular movements admitted into it, and
which had burdened it with infinite perplexity, though they had hitherto
been recommended by an illusive simplicity, were demonstrated to be
incorrect. They were replaced by the real ones, the elliptical. Kepler,
as was his custom, ingenuously related his trials and disappointments.
Alluding on one occasion to this, he says: "My first error was that the
path of a planet is a perfect circle&mdash;an opinion which was a more
mischievous thief of my time, in proportion as it was supported by the
authority of all philosophers, and apparently agreeable to metaphysics."</p>


<p><span class="side">The philosophical import of these laws.</span>The philosophical significance of Kepler's discoveries was not recognized
by the ecclesiastical party at first. It is chiefly this, that they
constitute a most important step to the establishment of the doctrine of
the government of the world by law. But it was impossible to receive
these laws without seeking for their cause. The result to which that
search eventually conducted not only explained their origin, but also
showed that, as laws, they must, in the necessity of nature, exist. It
may be truly said that the mathematical exposition of their origin
constitutes the most splendid monument of the intellectual power of man.</p>


<p><span class="side">Necessity for mechanical science.</span>Before the heliocentric theory could be developed and made to furnish a
clear exposition of the solar system, which is obviously the first step
to just views of the universe, it was necessary that the science of
mechanics should be greatly improved&mdash;indeed, it might be said, created;
for during those dreary ages following the establishment of Byzantine
power, nothing had been done toward the acquisition of correct views
either in statics or dynamics. It was impossible that Europe, in her
lower states of life, could produce men capable of commencing where
Archimedes had left off. She had to wait for the approach of her Age of
Reason for that.</p>


<p><span class="side">Leonardo da Vinci.</span>The man of capacity at last came. Leonardo da Vinci was born <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1452.
The historian Hallam, enumerating some of his works, observes, "His
knowledge was almost preternatural." Many of his <span class="pag">[269]</span>  writings <a id="still269"></a>still remain
unpublished. Long before Bacon, he laid down the maxim that experience
and observation must be the foundation of all reasoning in science; that
experiment is the only interpreter of nature, and is essential to the
ascertainment of laws. Unlike Bacon, who was ignorant of mathematics, and
even disparaged them, he points out their supreme advantage. Seven years
after the voyage of Columbus, this great man&mdash;great at once as an artist,
mathematician, and engineer&mdash;gave a clear exposition of the theory of
forces obliquely applied on a lever; a few years later he was well
acquainted with the earth's annual motion. He knew the laws of friction,
subsequently demonstrated by Amontons, and the principle of virtual
velocities; he described the camera obscura before Baptista Porta,
understood aerial perspective, the nature of coloured shadows, the use of
the iris, and the effects of the duration of visible impressions on the
eye. He wrote well on fortification, anticipated Castelli on hydraulics,
occupied himself with the fall of bodies on the hypothesis of the earth's
rotation, treated of the times of descent along inclined planes and
circular arcs, and of the nature of machines. He considered, with
singular clearness, respiration and combustion, and foreshadowed one of
the great hypotheses of geology, the elevation of continents.</p>


<p><span class="side">Stevinus continues the movement in Natural Philosophy.</span>This was the commencement of the movement in Natural Philosophy; it was
followed up by the publication of a work on the principles of equilibrium
by Stevinus, 1586. In this the author established the fundamental
property of the inclined plane, and solved, in a general manner, the
cases of forces acting obliquely. Six years later Galileo's treatise on
mechanics appeared, a fitting commencement of that career which, even had
it not been adorned with such brilliant astronomical discoveries, would
alone have conferred the most illustrious distinction upon him.</p>


<p><span  class="side">Discovery of the laws of motion.</span>The dynamical branch of Mechanics is that which is under most obligation
to Galileo. To him is due the establishment of the three laws of motion.
They are to the following effect, as given by Newton:</p>

<p>(1.) Every body perseveres in its state of rest or <span class="pag">[270]</span>  of <a id="uniform270"></a>uniform motion in
a right line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces
impressed thereon.</p>

<p>(2.) The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force
impressed, and is made in the direction of the right line in which that
force is impressed.</p>

<p>(3.) To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction, or the
mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and
directed to contrary parts.</p>

<p>Up to this time it was the general idea that motion can only be
maintained by a perpetual application, impression, or expenditure of
force. Galileo himself for many years entertained that error, but in 1638
he plainly states in his "Dialogues on Mechanics" the true law of the
uniformity and perpetuity of motion. Such a view necessarily implies a
correct and clear appreciation of the nature of resistances. No
experimental motion that man can establish is unrestrained. But a
perception of the uniformity and perpetuity of motion lies at the very
basis of physical astronomy. With difficulty the true idea was attained.
The same may be said as respects rectilinear direction, for many supposed
that uniform motion can only take place in a circle.</p>



<p><span class="side">Establishment of the first law of motion,</span>The establishment of the first law of motion was essential to the
discovery of the laws of falling bodies, in which the descent is made
under the influence of a continually acting force, the velocity
increasing in consequence thereof. Galileo saw clearly that, whether a
body is moving slowly or swiftly, it will be equally affected by gravity.
This principle was with difficulty admitted by some, who were disposed to
believe that a swiftly moving body would not be as much affected by a
constant force like gravity as one the motion of which is slower. With
difficulty, also, was the old Aristotelian error eradicated that a heavy
body falls more swiftly than a light one.</p>



<p><span class="side">and of the second,</span>The second law of motion was also established and illustrated by Galileo.
In his "Dialogues" he shows that a body projected horizontally must have,
from what has been said, a uniform horizontal motion, but that it will
also have compounded therewith an accelerated motion downward. Here again
we perceive it is<span class="pag">[271]</span>  necessary <a id="to271"></a>to retain a steady conception of this
intermingling of forces without deterioration, and, though it may seem
simple enough to us, there were some eminent men of those times who did
not receive it as true. The special case offered by Galileo is
theoretically connected with the paths of military projectiles, though in
practice, since they move in a resisting medium, the air, their path is
essentially different from the parabola. Curvilinear motions, which
necessarily arise from the constant action of a central force, making a
body depart from the rectilinear path it must otherwise take, are chiefly
of interest, as we shall presently find, in the movements of the
celestial bodies.</p>


<p><span class="side">and of the third.</span>A thorough exposition of the third law of motion was left by Galileo to
his successors, who had directed their attention especially to the
determination of the laws of impact. Indeed, the whole subject was
illustrated and the truth of the three laws verified in many different
cases by an examination of the phenomena of freely falling bodies,
pendulums, projectiles, and the like. Among those who occupied themselves
with such labours may be mentioned Torricelli, Castelli, Viviani,
Borelli, Gassendi. Through the investigations of these, and other
Italian, French, and English natural philosophers, the principles of
Mechanics were solidly established, and a necessary preparation made for
their application in astronomy. By this time every one had become ready
to admit that the motion of the planetary bodies would find an
explanation on these principles.</p>


<p><span class="side">Application of Mechanics to the celestial motions.</span>The steps thus far taken for an explanation of the movements of the
planets in curvilinear paths therefore consisted in the removal of the
old misconception that for a body to continue its motion forward in a
straight line a continued application of force is necessary, the first
law of motion disposing of that error. In the next place, it was
necessary that clear and distinct ideas should be held of the combination
or composition of forces, each continuing to exercise its influence
without deterioration or diminution by the other. The time had now come
for it to be shown that the perpetual movement of the planets is a
consequence of the first law <span class="pag">[272]</span>  of <a id="motion272"></a>motion; their elliptic paths, such as
had been determined by Kepler, a consequence of the second. Several
persons almost simultaneously had been brought nearly to this conclusion
without being able to solve the problem completely. Thus Borelli, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1666, in treating of the motions of Jupiter's satellites, distinctly
shows how a circular motion may arise under the influence of a central
force; he even uses the illustration so frequently introduced of a stone
whirled round in a sling. In the same year a paper was presented to the
Royal Society by Mr. Hooke, "explicating the inflection of a direct
motion into a circular by a supervening attractive principle." Huygens
also, in his "Horologium Oscillatorium," had published some theorems on
circular motions, but no one as yet had been able to show how elliptical
orbits could, upon these principles, be accounted for, though very many
had become satisfied that the solution of this problem would before long
be given.</p>


<p><span class="side">Newton; publication of the "Principia."</span>In April, 1686, the "Principia" of Newton was presented to the Royal
Society. This immortal work not only laid the foundation of Physical
Astronomy, it also carried the structure thereof very far toward its
completion. It unfolded the mechanical theory of universal gravitation
upon the principle that all bodies tend to approach each other with
forces directly as their masses, and inversely as the squares of their
distances.</p>


<p><span class="side">Propounds the theory of universal gravitation.</span>To the force producing this tendency of bodies to approach each other the
designation of attraction of gravitation, or gravity, is given. All heavy
bodies fall to the earth in such a way that the direction of their
movement is toward its centre. Newton proved that this is the direction
in which they must necessarily move under the influence of an attraction
of every one of the particles of which the earth is composed, the
attraction of a sphere taking effect as if all its particles were
concentrated in its centre.</p>


<p><span class="side">Preparation for Newton.</span>Galileo had already examined the manner in which gravity acts upon bodies
as an accelerating force, and had determined the connexion between the
spaces of descent and the times. He illustrated such facts experimentally
by the use of inclined planes, by the aid <span class="pag">[273]</span>  of <a id="which273"></a>which the velocity may be
conveniently diminished without otherwise changing the nature of the
result. He had also demonstrated that the earth's attraction acts equally
on all bodies. This he proved by inclosing various substances in hollow
spheres, and showing that, when they were suspended by strings of equal
length and made to vibrate, the time of oscillation was the same for all.
On the invention of the air-pump, a more popular demonstration of the
same fact was given by the experiment proving that a gold coin and a
feather fall equally swiftly in an exhausted receiver. Galileo had also
proved, by experiments on the leaning tower of Pisa, that the velocity of
falling bodies is independent of their weight. It was for these
experiments that he was expelled from that city.</p>


<p><span class="side">Extension of attraction or gravity.</span>Up to the time of Newton there were only very vague ideas that the
earth's attraction extended to any considerable distance. Newton was led
to his discovery by reflecting that at all altitudes accessible to man,
gravity appears to be undiminished, and that, therefore, it may possibly
extend as far as the moon, and actually be the force which deflects her
from a rectilinear path, and makes her revolve in an orbit round the
earth. Admitting the truth of the law of the inverse squares, it is easy
to compute whether the moon falls from the tangent she would describe if
the earth ceased to act upon her by a quantity proportional to that
observed in the case of bodies falling near the surface. In the first
calculations made by Newton, he found that the moon is deflected from the
tangent thirteen feet every minute; but, if the hypothesis of gravitation
were true, her deflection should be fifteen feet. It is no trifling
evidence of the scrupulous science of this great philosopher that
hereupon he put aside the subject for several years, without, however,
abandoning it. At length, in 1682, learning the result of the measures of
a degree which Picard had executed in France, and which affected the
estimate of the magnitude of the earth he had used, and therefore the
distance of the moon, he repeated the calculations with these improved
data. It is related that "he went home, took out his old papers, and
resumed his calculations. As they drew to a close, he became so much
agitated that he was obliged <span class="pag">[274]</span>  to <a id="desire274"></a>desire a friend to finish them." The
expected coincidence was verified. And thus it appeared that the moon is
retained in her orbit and made to revolve round the earth by the force of
terrestrial gravity.</p>


<p><span class="side">The cause of Kepler's laws.</span>These calculations were founded upon the hypothesis that the moon moves
in a circular orbit with a uniform velocity. But in the "Principia" it
was demonstrated that when a body moves under the influence of an
attractive force, varying as the inverse square of the distances, it must
describe a conic section, with a focus at the centre of force, and under
the circumstances designated by Kepler's laws. Newton, therefore, did far
more than furnish the expected solution of the problem of elliptical
motion, and it was now apparent that the existence of those laws might
have been foreseen, since they arise in the very necessities of the case.</p>


<p><span class="side">Resistless spread of the heliocentric theory.</span>This point gained, it is obvious that the evidence was becoming
unquestionable, that as the moon is made to revolve round the earth
through the influence of an attractive force exercised by the earth, so
likewise each of the planets is compelled to move in an elliptical orbit
round the sun by his attractive force. The heliocentric theory, at this
stage, was presenting physical evidence of its truth. It was also
becoming plain that the force we call gravitation must be imputed to the
sun, and to all the planetary bodies as well as to the earth.
Accordingly, this was what Newton asserted in respect to all material
substance.</p>


<p><span class="side">Perturbations accounted for.</span>But it is a necessary consequence of this theory that many apparent
irregularities and perturbations of the bodies of the solar system must
take place by reason of the attraction of each upon all the others. If
there were but one planet revolving round the sun, its orbit might be a
mathematically perfect ellipse; but the moment a second is introduced,
perturbation takes place in a variable manner as the bodies change their
positions or distances. An excessive complication must therefore be the
consequence when the number of bodies is great. Indeed, so insurmountable
would these difficulties be, that the mathematical solution of the
general problem of the solar system would be hopeless were it not for the
fact that <span class="pag">[275]</span>  the <a id="planetary275"></a>planetary bodies are at very great distances from one
another, and their masses, compared with the mass of the sun, very small.</p>


<p><span class="side">Results of the theory of gravitation.</span>Taking the theory of gravitation in its universal acceptation, Newton, in
a manner that looks as if he were divinely inspired, succeeded in
demonstrating the chief inequalities of the moon and planetary bodies; in
determining the figure of the earth&mdash;that it is not a perfect sphere, but
an oblate spheroid; in explaining the precession of the equinoxes and the
tides of the ocean. To such perfection have succeeding mathematicians
brought his theory, that the most complicated movements and
irregularities of the solar system have been satisfactorily accounted for
and reduced to computation. Trusting to these principles, not only has it
been found possible, knowing the mass of a given planet, to determine the
perturbations it may produce in adjacent ones, but even the inverse
problem has been successfully attacked, and from the perturbations the
place and mass of a hitherto unknown planet determined. It was thus that,
from the deviations of Uranus from his theoretical place, the necessary
existence of an exterior disturbing planet was foreseen, and our times
have witnessed the intellectual triumph of mathematicians directing where
the telescope should point in order to find a new planet. The discovery
of Neptune was thus accomplished.</p>

<p>It adds to our admiration of the wonderful intellectual powers of Newton
to know that the mathematical instrument he used was the ancient
geometry. Not until subsequently was the analytical method resorted to
and cultivated. This method possesses the inappreciable advantage of
relieving us from the mental strain which would otherwise oppress us. It
has been truly said that the symbols think for us.
<span  class="side">The "Principia;" its incomparable merit.</span>
Mr. Whewell observes:
"No one for sixty years after the publication of the 'Principia,' and,
with Newton's methods, no one up to the present day, has added any thing
of value to his deductions. We know that he calculated all the principal
lunar inequalities; in many of the cases he has given us his processes,
in others only his results. But who has presented in his beautiful
geometry or <span class="pag">[276]</span>  deduced <a id="from276"></a>from his simple principles any of the inequalities
which he left untouched? The ponderous instrument of synthesis, so
effective in his hands, has never since been grasped by any one who could
use it for such purposes; and we gaze at it with admiring curiosity, as
on some gigantic implement of war which stands idle among the memorials
of ancient days, and makes us wonder what manner of man he was who could
wield as a weapon what we can hardly lift as a burden."</p>


<p><span class="side">Philosophical import of Newton's discoveries.</span>Such was the physical meaning of Newton's discoveries; their
philosophical meaning was of even greater importance. The paramount truth
was resistlessly coming into prominence&mdash;that the government of the solar
system is under necessity, and that it is mathematically impossible for
the laws presiding over it to be other than they are.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the law of gravitation holds good throughout our
solar system. But the heliocentric theory, in its most general
acceptation, considers every fixed star as being, like the sun, a
planetary centre.
<span class="side">Unity of idea in the construction of the universe.</span>
Hence, before it can be asserted that the theory of
gravitation is truly universal, it must be shown that it holds good in
the case of all other such systems. The evidence offered in proof of this
is altogether based upon the observations of the two Herschels on the
motions of the double stars. Among the stars there are some in such close
proximity to each other that Sir W. Herschel was led to suppose it would
be possible, from observations upon them, to ascertain the stellar
parallax. While engaged in these inquiries, which occupied him for many
years, he discovered that many of these stars are not merely optically in
proximity, as being accidentally in the same line of view, but are
actually connected physically, revolving round each other in regular
orbits. The motion of these double suns is, however, in many instances so
slow as to require many years for a satisfactory determination.
<span  class="side">Gravitation of double stars.</span>
Sir J. Herschel therefore continued the observations of his father, and with
other mathematicians, investigated the characteristics of these motions.
The first instance in which the true elliptic elements of the orbit of a
binary star were <span class="pag">[277]</span>  determined <a id="was277"></a>was given by M. Savary in the case of
chi Ursæ Majoris, indicating an elliptic orbit of 58 &frac14; years.
But the period of others, since determined, is very much longer; thus, in
sigma Coronæ, it is, according to Mr. Hind, more than 736 years.
From the fact that the orbits in which these stars move round each other
are elliptical, it necessarily follows that the law of gravitation,
according to the inverse square, holds good in them. Considering the
prodigious distances of these bodies, and the departure, as regards
structure of the systems to which they belong, from the conditions
obtaining in our unisolar system, we may perhaps assert the prevalence of
the law of gravitation throughout the universe.</p>


<p><span class="side">Coloured light of double stars.</span>If, in association with these double suns&mdash;sometimes, indeed, they are
triple, and occasionally, as in the case of epsilon Lyræ,
quadruple&mdash;there are opaque planetary globes, such solar systems differ
from ours not only in having several suns instead of a single one, but,
since the light emitted is often of different tints, one star shining
with a crimson and another with a blue light, the colours not always
complementary to one another, a wonderful variety of phenomena must be
the result, especially in their organic creations; for organic forms,
both vegetable and animal, primarily depend on the relations of coloured
light. How varied the effects where there are double, triple, or even
quadruple sunrises, and sunsets, and noons; and the hours marked off by
red, or purple, or blue tints.</p>


<p><span class="side">Grandeur of Newton's discoveries.</span>It is impossible to look back on the history of the theory of gravitation
without sentiments of admiration and, indeed, of pride. How felicitous
has been the manner in which have been explained the inequalities of a
satellite like the moon under the disturbing influence of the sun; the
correspondence between the calculated and observed quantities of these
inequalities; the extension of the doctrine to satellites of other
planets, as those of Jupiter; the determination of the earth's figure;
the causes of the tides; the different force of gravity in different
latitudes, and a multitude of other phenomena. The theory asserted for
itself that authority which belongs to intrinsic truth. It <span class="pag">[278]</span>  enabled
<a id="mathematicians278"></a>mathematicians to point out facts not yet observed, and to foretell
future events.</p>

<p>And yet how hard it is for truth to force its way when bigotry resists.
In 1771, the University of Salamanca, being urged to teach physical
science, refused, and this was its answer; "Newton teaches nothing that
would make a good logician or metaphysician; and Gassendi and Descartes
do not agree so well with revealed truth as Aristotle does."</p>


<p><span class="side">The earth in time.</span>Among the interesting results of Newton's theory may be mentioned its
application to secular inequalities, such as the acceleration of the
moon's mean motion, that satellite moving somewhat quicker now than she
did ages ago. Laplace detected the cause of this phenomenon in the
influence of the sun upon the moon, combined with the secular variation
of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit. Moreover, he showed that this
secular inequality of the motion of the moon is periodical, that it
requires millions of years to re-establish itself, and that, after an
almost inconceivable time, the acceleration becomes a retardation. In
like manner, the same mathematician explained the observed acceleration
in the mean motion of Jupiter, and retardation of that of Saturn, as
arising from the mutual attraction of the two planets, and showed that
this secular inequality has a period of 929 &frac12; years. With such slow
movements may be mentioned the diminution of the obliquity of the
ecliptic, which has been proceeding for ages, but which will reach a
limit and then commence to increase. These secular motions ought not to
be without interest to those who suffer themselves to adopt the patristic
chronology of the world, who suppose that the earth is only six thousand
years old, and that it will come to an end in about one thousand years
more. They must accept, along with that preposterous delusion, its
necessary consequences, that the universe has been so badly constructed,
and is such a rickety machine, that it can not hold together long enough
for some of its wheels to begin to revolve. Astronomy offers us many
illustrations of the scale upon which the world is constructed as to
time, as well as that upon which it is constructed as to space.</p>


<p><span class="side">Dominion of law in the universe.</span>From  what has been said, the conclusion forces <span class="pag">[279]</span>  itself <a id="upon279"></a>upon us that the
general laws obtaining as respects the earth, hold good likewise for all
other parts of the universe; a conclusion sustained not only by the
mechanism of such motions as we have been considering, but also by all
evidence of a physical kind accessible to us. The circumstances under
which our sun emits light and heat, and thereby vivifies his attendant
planets, are indisputably the same as those obtaining in the case of
every fixed star, each of which is a self-luminous sun. There is thus an
aspect of homogeneousness in the structure of all systems in the
universe, which, though some have spoken of it as if it were the
indication of a uniformity of plan, and therefore the evidence of a
primordial idea, is rather to be looked upon as the proof of unchangeable
and resistless law.</p>


<p><span class="side">Ruin of anthropocentric ideas.</span>What, therefore, now becomes of the doctrine authoritatively put forth,
and made to hold its sway for so many centuries, that the earth is not
only the central-body of the universe, but in reality, the most noble
body in it; that the sun and other stars are mere ministers or attendants
for human use? In the place of these utterly erroneous and unworthy
views, far different conceptions must be substituted. Man, when he looks
upon the countless multitude of stars&mdash;when he reflects that all he sees
is only a little portion of those which exist, yet that each is a light
and life-giving sun to multitudes of opaque, and therefore, invisible
worlds&mdash;when he considers the enormous size of these various bodies and
their immeasurable distance from one another, may form an estimate of the
scale on which the world is constructed, and learn therefrom his own
unspeakable insignificance.</p>


<p><span class="side">Aids for measurements in the universe.</span>In one beat of a pendulum a ray of light would pass eight times round the
circumference of the earth. Thus we may take the sunbeam as a carpenter
does his measuring-rule; it serves as a gauge in our measurements of the
universe. A sunbeam would require more than three years to reach us from
alpha Centauri; nine and a quarter years from 61 Cygni; from alpha Lyræ
 twelve years. These are stars whose parallax has been determined,
and which are therefore nearest to us.</p>


<p><span class="side">Clusters of stars.</span> <span class="pag">[280]</span>  <a id="Of280"></a>Of suns visible to the naked eye
there are about 8000, but the telescope
can discern in the Milky Way more than eighteen millions, the number
visible increasing as more powerful instruments are used. Our cluster of
stars is a disc divided into two branches at about one-third of its
length. In the midst of innumerable compeers and superiors, the sun is
not far from the place of bifurcation, and at about the middle of the
thickness. Outside the plane of the Milky Way the appearance would be
like a ring, and, still farther off, a nebulous disc.</p>


<p><span class="side">Distribution of matter and force in space.</span>From the contemplation of isolated suns and congregated clusters we are
led to the stupendous problem of the distribution of matter and force in
space, and to the interpretation of those apparent phantoms of
self-luminous vapour, circular and elliptic discs, spiral wreaths, rings
and fans, whose edges fade doubtfully away, twins and triplets of
phosphorescent haze connected together by threads of light and grotesque
forms of indescribable complexity. Perhaps in some of these gleaming
apparitions we see the genesis, in some the melting away of universes.
There is nothing motionless in the sky. In every direction vast
transformations are occurring, yet all things proclaim the eternity of
matter and the undiminished perpetuity of force.</p>


<p><span class="side">Limit of the theory of gravitation.</span>The theory of gravitation, as delivered by Newton, thus leads us to a
knowledge of the mathematical construction of the solar system, and
inferentially likewise to that of other systems; but it leaves without
explanation a large number of singular facts. It explains the existing
conditions of equilibrium of the heavenly bodies, but it tells us nothing
of their genesis; or, at the best, in that particular it falls back on
the simple fiat of God.</p>


<p><span class="side">Phenomena of the solar system.</span>The facts here referred to conduct us, however, to another and far higher
point of view. Some of them, as enumerated by Laplace, are the
following:&mdash;1. All the planets and their satellites move in ellipses of
such small eccentricity that they are nearly circles; 2. The movements of
the planets are in the same direction and nearly in the same plane; 3.
The movements of the satellites are in the same direction as those of
<span class="pag">[281]</span>  the <a id="planets281"></a>planets; 4. The movements of rotation of these various bodies and of
the sun are in the same direction as their orbitual motions, and in
planes little different.</p>


<p><span class="side">The nebular hypothesis.</span>The nebular hypothesis requires us to admit that all the ponderable
material now constituting the various bodies of the solar system once
extended in a rarefied or nebulous and rotating condition, beyond the
confines of the most distant planet. That postulate granted; the
structure and present condition of the system may be mathematically
deduced.</p>

<p>For, as the vast rotating spheroid lost its heat by radiation, it
contracted, and its velocity of rotation was necessarily increased; and
thus were left behind from its equatorial zone, by reason of the
centrifugal force, rotating rings, the same result occurring periodically
again and again. These rings must lie all in one plane. They might break,
collapsing into one rotating spheroid, a planet; or into many, asteroids;
or maintain the ring-like form. From the larger of these secondary
rotating spheroids other rings might be thrown off, as from the parent
mass; these, in their turn breaking and becoming spheroids, constitute
satellites, whose movements correspond to those of their primaries.</p>

<p>We might, indeed, advance a step farther, and show how, by the radiation
of heat from a motionless nebula, a movement of rotation in a determinate
direction could be engendered, and that upon these principles, the
existence of a nebulous matter admitted, and the present laws and forces
of nature regarded as having been unchanged, the manner of origin of the
solar system might be deduced, and all those singular facts previously
alluded to explained; and not only so, but there is spontaneously
suggested the cause of many minor peculiarities not yet mentioned.</p>


<p><span class="side">Facts accounted for by it.</span>For it follows from the nebular hypothesis that the large planets should
rotate rapidly, and the small ones more slowly; that the outer planets
and satellites should be larger than the inner ones. Of the satellites of
Saturn, the largest is the outermost; of those of Jupiter, the largest is
the outermost save one. Of the planets themselves, Jupiter is the
largest, and outermost save three. These cannot be coincidences, <span class="pag">[282]</span>  but
<a id="must282"></a>must be due to law. The number of satellites of each planet, with the
doubtful exception of Venus, might be foreseen, the presence of
satellites and their number being determined by the centrifugal force of
their primary. The hypothesis also points out the time of revolution of
the planets in their orbits, and of the satellites in theirs; it
furnishes a reason for the genesis and existence of Saturn's rings, which
are indeed its remaining witnesses&mdash;their position and movements
answering to its requirements. It accounts for the physical state of the
sun, and also for the physical state of the earth and moon as indicated
by their geology. It is also not without furnishing reasons for the
existence of comets as integrant members of our system; for their
singular physical state; for the eccentric, almost parabolic orbits of so
many of them; for the fact that there are as many of them with a
retrograde as with a direct motion; for their more frequent occurrence
about the axis of the solar system than in its plane; and for their
general antithetical relations to planets.</p>


<p><span class="side">Whether nebulæ actually exist.</span>If these and very many other apparently disconnected facts follow as the
mechanical necessities of the admission of a gravitating nebula&mdash;a very
simple postulate&mdash;it becomes important to ascertain whether, by actual
observation, the existence of such material forms may be demonstrated in
any part of the universe. It was the actual telescopic observation of
such objects that led Herschel to the nebular hypothesis. He concluded
that there are two distinct kinds of nebulæ, one consisting of clusters
of stars so remote that they could not be discerned individually, but
that these may be discerned by sufficient telescopic power; the other
being of a hazy nature, and incapable of resolution. Nebulæ do not occur
at random in the heavens: the regions poorest in stars are richest in
them; they are few in the plane of our sidereal system, but numerous
about its poles, in that respect answering to the occurrence of comets in
the solar system. The resolution of many of these hazy patches of light
into stars by no means disproves the truly nebulous condition of many
others.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, other means than telescopic observation for the
settlement of this question are <span class="pag">[283]</span>  available. <a id="In283"></a>In 1846, it was discovered by
the author of this book that the spectrum of an ignited solid is
continuous, that is, has neither dark nor bright fixed lines. Fraunhofer
had previously made known that the spectrum of ignited gases is
discontinuous. Here, then, is the means of determining whether the light
emitted by a given nebula comes from an incandescent gas, or from a
congeries of ignited solids, stars, or suns. If its spectrum be
discontinuous, it is a true nebula or gas; if continuous, a congeries of
stars.</p>

<p>In 1864, Mr. Huggins made this examination in the case of a nebula in the
constellation Draco. It proved to be gaseous.</p>

<p>Subsequent observations have shown that of sixty nebulæ examined,
nineteen give discontinuous or gaseous spectra; the remainder continuous
ones.</p>

<p>It may, therefore, be admitted that physical evidence has at length been
obtained, demonstrating the existence of vast masses of matter in a
gaseous condition, and at a temperature of incandescence. The hypothesis
of Laplace has thus a firm basis.</p>


<p><span class="side">Opposition to the nebular hypothesis.</span>Notwithstanding the great authority of the astronomers who introduced it,
the nebular hypothesis has encountered much adverse criticism; not so
much, however, from its obvious scientific defects, such as its inability
to deal with the cases of Uranus and Neptune, as from moral and
extraneous considerations. There is a line in Aristophanes which points
out precisely the difficulty:</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&#8009; &Zeta;&epsilon;&#8058;&sigmaf;
&omicron;&#8016;&kappa; &#8036;&nu;, &#7936;&lambda;&lambda;' &#7936;&nu;&tau;'
&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&omicron;&#8166; &Delta;&#8150;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&nu;&upsilon;&nu;&#8054; &beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8059;&omega;&nu;.</span>
</div>

<p>A reluctance to acknowledge the presidency of law in the existing
constitution and movements of the solar system has been yielded only to
be succeeded by a reluctance to acknowledge the presidency of law in its
genesis. And yet whoever will reflect on the subject will be drawn to the
conclusion that the principle involved was really settled by Newton in
his "Principia"&mdash;that is to say, when it became geometrically certain
that Kepler's laws originate in a mathematical necessity.</p>

<p>As matters now stand, the nebular hypothesis may <span class="pag">[284]</span>  be <a id="regarded284"></a>regarded as the
first superficial, and therefore imperfect, glimpse of a series of the
grandest problems soon to present themselves for solution&mdash;the
mathematical distribution of matter and force in space, and the
variations of that distribution in time.</p>


<p><span class="side">The intellectual ruin of ecclesiasticism.</span>Such is the history of the dispute respecting the position of the earth
in the universe. Not without reason, therefore, have I assigned the
pontificate of Nicolas&nbsp;V. as the true close of the intellectual dominion
of the Church. From that time the sceptre had passed into another hand.
In all directions Nature was investigated, in all directions new methods
of examination were yielding unexpected and beautiful results. On the
ruins of its ivy-grown cathedrals, Ecclesiasticism, surprised and blinded
by the breaking day, sat solemnly blinking at the light and life about
it, absorbed in the recollection of the night that had passed, dreaming
of new phantoms and delusions in its wished-for return, and vindictively
striking its talons at any derisive assailant who incautiously approached
too near. I have not space to describe the scientific activity displayed
in all directions; to do it justice would demand volumes. Mathematics,
physics, chemistry, anatomy, medicine, and all the many branches of human
knowledge received an impulse.
<span  class="side">Wonderful development of scientific activity.</span>
Simultaneously with the great events I
have been relating, every one of these branches was advancing. Vieta made
the capital improvement of using letters as general symbols in algebra,
and applied that science to geometry. Tycho, emulating Hipparchus of old,
made a new catalogue of the stars; he determined that comets are beyond
the moon, and that they cut the crystalline firmament of theology in all
directions. Gilbert wrote his admirable book on the magnet; Gesner led
the way to zoology, taking it up at the point to which the Saracens had
continued Aristotle, by the publication of his work on the history of
animals; Belon at the same time, 1540, was occupied with fishes and
birds. Fallopius and Eustachius, Arantius and Varolius, were
immortalizing themselves by their dissections: the former reminding us of
the times of Ptolemy Philadelphus, when he naïvely confesses "the Duke of
 Tuscany <a id="was285"></a>was <span class="pag">[285]</span> obliging enough to send living criminals to us, whom we
killed and then dissected." Piccolomini laid the foundations of general
anatomy by his description of cellular tissue. Coiter created
pathological anatomy, Prosper Alpinus diagnosis, Plater the
classification of disease, and Ambrose Paré modern surgery. Such were the
occupations and prospect of science at the close of the sixteenth
century.</p>


<p><span class="side">The movement becomes still more vigorous.</span>
Scarcely had the seventeenth opened when it became obvious that the
movement, far from slackening, was gathering force. It was the age of
Galileo. Descartes introduced the theory of an ether and vortices; but,
hearing of the troubles that had befallen Galileo, was on the point of
burning his papers. Several years later, he was restrained from
publishing his "Cosmos" "from a pious desire not to treat irreverently
the decrees of the holy chair against the planetary movement of the
earth." This was in 1633, when the report of the sentence of the
Inquisition was made known. He also developed Vieta's idea of the
application of algebra to geometry, and brought into prominence the
mechanical fact, destined to an important application in physical
astronomy, that every curvilinear deflection is due to a controlling
force. To him, among Europeans, also is to be attributed the true
explanation of the rise of water in an exhausted space&mdash;"the weight of
the water counter-balances that of the air." Napier perfected his great
and useful invention of logarithms. Hydraulics was created by Castelli;
hydrostatics by Torricelli, who also discovered barometric variations:
both were pupils of Galileo. Fabricius ab Aquapendente discovered the
valves in the veins; Servetus almost detected the course of the
circulation. Harvey completed what Servetus had left unfinished, and
described the entire course of the blood; Asellius discovered the
lacteals; Van Helmont introduced the theory of vitality into medicine,
and made the practice or art thereof consist in regulating by diet the
Archeus, whose seat he affirmed to be in the stomach. In strong contrast
with this phantasy, Sanctorio laid the foundation of modern physiology by
introducing the balance into its inquiries. Pascal, by a decisive
experiment, established the   doctrines <a id="of286"></a>of <span class="pag">[286]</span>the weight and pressure of the
air, and published some of the most philosophical treatises of the age:
"his Provincial Letters did more than any thing to ruin the name of the
Jesuits." The contagion spread to the lawyers: in 1672 appeared
Puffendorf's work on the "Law of Nature and Nations." The phlogistic
theory, introduced by Beccher and perfected by Stahl, created chemistry,
in contradistinction to the Arabian alchemy. Otto Guericke invented the
air-pump, Boyle improved it. Hooke, among many other discoveries,
determined the essential conditions of combustion. Far above all
contemporaries in mathematical learning and experimental skill, Newton
was already turning his attention to the "reflexions, refractions,
inflexions and colours of light," and introducing the idea of attractions
into physics. Ray led the way to comparative anatomy in his synopsis of
quadrupeds; Swammerdam improved the art of dissection, applying it to the
general history of insects; Lister published his synopsis of shells;
Tournefort and Malpighi devoted themselves to botany; Grew discovered the
sexes of plants; Brown the quinary arrangement of flowers. Geology began
to break loose from the trammels of theology, and Burnet's Sacred theory
of the Earth could not maintain its ground against more critical
investigations. The Arabian doctrine of the movement of the crust of the
earth began to find supporters. Lister ascertained the continuity of
strata over great distances; Woodward improved mineralogy; the great
mathematician, Leibnitz, the rival of Newton, propounded the doctrine of
the gradual cooling of the globe, the descent of its strata by fracture,
the deposit of sedimentary rocks, and their induration. Among physicians,
Willis devoted himself to the study of the brain, traced the course of
the nerves and classified them, and introduced the doctrine of the
localization of functions in the brain. Malpighi and Lewenh&oelig;ck applied
the microscope as an aid to anatomy; the latter discovered spermatozoa.
Graaf studied the function of the generative organs; Borelli attempted
the application of mathematics to muscular movement; Duverney wrote on
the sense of hearing, Mayow on respiration; Ruysch perfected the art of
injection, and improved minute anatomy.</p>

<p> <span class="pag">[287]</span>  <a id="But287"></a>But it is in vain to go on. The remainder of these pages would be
consumed in an attempt to record the names of the cultivators of science,
every year increasing in number, and to do justice to their works. From
the darkness that had for so many ages enveloped it, the human mind at
last emerged into light. The intellectual motes were dancing in the
sunbeam, and making it visible in every direction.</p>


<p><span class="side">Institution of scientific societies.</span>Despairing thus to do justice to individual philosophers and individual
discoveries, there is, however, one most important event to which I must
prominently allude. It is the foundation of learned societies. Imitating
the examples of the Academia Secretorum Naturæ, instituted at Naples,
1560, by Baptista Porta, and of the Lyncean Academy, founded 1603 by
Prince Frederic Cesi at Rome for the promotion of natural philosophy, the
Accademia del Cimento was established at Florence, 1637; the Royal
Society of London, 1645; and the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris,
1666.</p>

<hr />


<p><span class="side">Review of anthropocentric philosophy.</span>Arrived at the close of the description of this first great victory of
scientific truth over authority and tradition, it is well for us to pause
and look back on the progress of man from the erroneous inferences of his
social infancy to the true conclusions of his maturity&mdash;from
anthropocentric ideas, which in all nations and parts of the world have
ever been the same, to the discovery of his true position and
insignificance in the universe.</p>



<p><span class="side">The sky, apparent nature of.</span>We are placed in a world surrounded with illusions. The daily events of
our life and the objects before us tend equally to deceive us. If we cast
our eyes on the earth, it seems to be made only to minister to our
pleasures or our wants. If we direct our attention to the sky, that blue
and crystalline dome, the edges of which rest on the flat land or the
sea&mdash;a glacial vault, which Empedocles thought was frozen air, and the
fathers of the Church the lowest of the seven concentric strata of
heavens&mdash;we find a thousand reasons for believing that whatever it covers
was intended by some Good Being for our use. Of the various <span class="pag">[288]</span>  living
<a id="things288"></a>things placed with us beneath it, all are of an inferior grade when
compared with ourselves, and all seem intended for us. The conclusions at
which we thus arrive are strengthened by a principle of vanity implanted
in our hearts, unceasingly suggesting to us that this pleasant abode must
have been prepared for our reception, and furnished and ornamented
expressly for our use.</p>



<p><span class="side">Anthropocentric ideas of God.</span>But reflexion teaches us that we came not hither of ourselves, and that
doubtless the same Good Being who prepared this delightful abode brought
us as tenants into it. From the fact of our own existence, we are
insensibly and inevitably led to infer the existence of God; from the
favourable circumstances in which our lot is cast, we gather evidences of
His goodness; and in the energy which natural phenomena often display, we
see the tokens of His power. What other explanation can we give of
tempests in the sea or lightning in the heavens? Moreover, it is only
during a part of our time&mdash;our waking hours&mdash;that we are brought into
relation with these material things; for the rest, when we are asleep, a
state in which we spend more than a third part of our life, we are
introduced to other scenery, other beings, another world.
<span  class="side">Of the world and heaven.</span>
 From these we
gather that there are agents of an intangible and more ethereal mould,
perhaps of the nature of Him who brought us here, perhaps His
subordinates and messengers. Whence do they issue and whither do they go?
Is there not beyond the sky above us a region to which our imperfect
vision cannot penetrate, but which may be accessible to them from the
peaks of elevated mountains, or to be reached only with wings? And thus
we picture to ourselves a heaven shut off from earth, with all its sins
and cares, by the untroubled and impenetrable sky&mdash;a place of light and
repose, its pavement illuminated by the sun and countless other shining
bodies&mdash;a place of peace, but also a place of power.</p>


<p><span class="side">Of evil beings and hell.</span>Still more, a thousand facts of our life teach us that we are exposed to
influences of an evil nature as well as to those that are good. How
often, in our dreams, does it happen that we are terror-stricken by the
approach of hideous forms, faces of fearful <span class="pag">[289]</span>  appearance, <a id="from289"></a>from which we
vainly struggle to escape. Is it not natural for us to attribute the evil
we see in the world to these as the good to those? and, since we can not
conceive of the existence of beings without assigning them a place, where
shall we find for these malignant spirits a habitation? Is it not in the
dark region beneath the ground, far away from the realms of light&mdash;a
region from which, through the volcano, smoke and burning sulphur are
cast into this upper world&mdash;a place of everlasting fire and darkness,
whose portals are in caves and solitudes of unutterable gloom?</p>


<p><span class="side">Of man, the supernatural.</span>Placed thus on the boundary between such opposing powers, man is the
sport of circumstances, sustained by beings who seek his happiness, and
tempted by those who desire his destruction. Is it at all surprising
that, guided by such obvious thoughts and simple reasonings, he becomes
superstitious? that he sees in every shadow a spirit, and peoples every
solitary place with invisibles? that he casts a longing look to the good
beings who can protect him, seeking to invoke their aid by entreaties,
and to propitiate their help by free-will sacrifices of things that are
pleasant and valuable? Open to such influences himself, why should he not
believe in the efficacy of prayer? His conscious superiority lends force
to his suspicion that he is a worthy object for the opposing powers to
contend for, a conclusion verified by the inward strifes he feels, as
well as by the trials of life to which he is exposed.</p>


<p><span class="side">His immortality and future life.</span>But dreams at night, and sometimes visions by day, serve to enforce the
conclusion that life is not limited to our transitory continuance here,
but endures hereafter. How often at night do we see the well-known forms
of those who have been dead a long time appearing before us with
surprising vividness, and hear their almost forgotten voices? These are
admonitions full of the most solemn suggestions, profoundly indicating to
us that the dead still continue to exist, and that what has happened to
them must also happen to us, and we too are destined for immortality.
Perhaps involuntarily we associate these conclusions with others,
expecting that in a future life good men will enjoy <span class="pag">[290]</span>  the <a id="society290"></a>society of good
beings like themselves, the evil being dismissed to the realms of
darkness and despair. And, as human experience teaches us that a final
allotment can only be made by some superior power, we expect that He who
was our Creator shall also be our Judge; that there is an appointed time
and a bar at which the final destination of all who have lived shall be
ascertained, and eternal justice measure out its punishments and rewards.</p>


<p><span class="side">Inducements to morality.</span>From these considerations there arises an inducement for us to lead a
virtuous life, abstaining from wickedness and wrong; to set apart a body
of men who may mediate for us, and teach us by precept and example the
course it is best for us to pursue; to consecrate places, such as groves
or temples, as the more immediate habitations of the Deity to which we
may resort.</p>

<p>Such are the leading doctrines of Natural Theology of primitive man both
in the old and new continent. They arise from the operations of the human
mind considering the fitness of things.</p>

<p>Just as we have in Comparative Anatomy the structure of different animals
examined, and their identities and differences set forth, thereby
establishing their true relations; just as we have in Comparative
Physiology the functions of one organic being compared with those of
another, to the end that we may therefrom deduce their proper connexions,
so, from the mythologies of various races of men, a Comparative Theology
may be constructed.
<span  class="side">Course of Comparative Theology.</span>
Through such a science alone can correct conclusions
be arrived at respecting this, the most important of the intellectual
operations of man&mdash;the definite process of his religious opinions. But it
must be borne in mind that Comparative Theology illustrates the result or
effect of the phase of life, and is not its cause.</p>


<p><span class="side">Corrections of anthropocentric ideas.</span>As man advances in knowledge he discovers that of his primitive
conclusions some are doubtless erroneous, and many require better
evidence to establish their truth incontestably. A more prolonged and
attentive examination gives him reason, in some of the most important
particulars, to change his mind. He finds that the earth on which he
lives is <span class="pag">[291]</span> not a <a id="floor291"></a>floor covered over with a starry dome, as he once
supposed, but a globe self-balanced in space. The crystalline vault, or
sky, is recognized to be an optical deception. It rests upon the earth
nowhere, and is no boundary at all; there is no kingdom of happiness
above it, but a limitless space, adorned with planets and suns. Instead
of a realm of darkness and woe in the depths on the other side of the
earth, men like ourselves are found there, pursuing, in Australia and New
Zealand, the innocent pleasures and encountering the ordinary labours of
life. By the aid of such lights as knowledge gradually supplies, he comes
at last to discover that this, our terrestrial habitation, instead of
being a chosen, a sacred spot, is only one of similar myriads, more
numerous than the sands of the sea, and prodigally scattered through
space.</p>


<p><span class="side">Consequence of discovering the form of the earth. </span>
Never, perhaps, was a more important truth discovered. All the visible
evidence was in direct opposition to it.
<span  class="side">Detection of its insignificance.</span>
The earth, which had hitherto
seemed to be the very emblem of immobility, was demonstrated to be
carried with a double motion, with prodigious velocity, through the
heavens; the rising and setting of the stars were proved to be an
illusion; and, as respects the size of the globe, it was shown to be
altogether insignificant when compared with multitudes of other
neighbouring ones&mdash;insignificant doubly by reason of its actual
dimensions, and by the countless numbers of others like it in form, and
doubtless, like it, the abodes of many orders of life.</p>

<p>And so it turns out that our earth is a globe of about twenty-five
thousand miles in circumference. The voyager who circumnavigates it
spends no inconsiderable portion of his life in accomplishing his task.
It moves round the sun in a year, but at so great a distance from that
luminary that, if seen from him, it would look like a little spark
traversing the sky. It is thus recognized as one of the members of the
solar system.
<span class="side">Other solar bodies.</span>
Other similar bodies, some of which are of larger, some of
smaller dimensions, perform similar revolutions round the sun in
appropriate periods of time.</p>


<p><span class="side">Magnitude of the universe.</span>If the magnitude of the earth be too great for us to attach to it any
definite conception, what shall we say <span class="pag">[292]</span> of <a id="the292"></a>the compass of the solar
system? There is a defect in the human intellect which incapacitates us
for comprehending distances and periods that are either too colossal or
too minute. We gain no clearer insight into the matter when we are told
that a comet which does not pass beyond the bounds of the system, may
perhaps be absent on its journey for more than a thousand years.
Distances and periods such as these are beyond our grasp. They prove to
us how far human reason excels imagination, the one measuring and
comparing things of which the other can form no conception, but in the
attempt is utterly bewildered and lost.</p>


<p><span class="side">The infinity of worlds.</span>But as there are other globes like our earth, so too there are other
worlds like our solar system. There are self-luminous suns exceeding in
number all computation. The dimensions of this earth pass into
nothingness in comparison with the dimensions of the solar system, and
that system, in its turn, is only an invisible point if placed in
relation with the countless hosts of other systems which form, with it,
clusters of stars. Our solar system, far from being alone in the
universe, is only one of an extensive brotherhood, bound by common laws
and subject to like influences. Even on the very verge of creation, where
imagination might lay the beginning of the realms of chaos, we see
unbounded proofs of order, a regularity in the arrangement of inanimate
things, suggesting to us that there are other intellectual creatures like
us, the tenants of those islands in the abysses of space.</p>

<p>Though it may take a beam of light a million of years to bring to our
view those distant worlds, the end is not yet. Far away in the depths of
space we catch the faint gleams of other groups of stars like our own.
The finger of a man can hide them in their remoteness. Their vast
distances from one another have dwindled into nothing. They and their
movements have lost all individuality; the innumerable suns of which they
are composed blend all their collected light into one pale milky glow.</p>


<p><span class="side">Insignificance of man.</span>Thus extending our view from the earth to the solar system, from the
solar system to the expanse of the group of stars to which we belong, we
<span class="pag">[293]</span> behold a <a id="series293"></a>series of gigantic nebular creations rising up one after
another, and forming greater and greater colonies of worlds. No numbers
can express them, for they make the firmament a haze of stars.
Uniformity, even though it be the uniformity of magnificence, tires at
last, and we abandon the survey, for our eyes can only behold a boundless

<p><span class="side">Triumph of scientific truth.</span>But what has become of the time-honoured doctrine of the human destiny of
the universe? that doctrine for the sake of which the controversy I have
described in this chapter was raised. It has disappeared. In vain was
Bruno burnt and Galileo imprisoned; the truth forced its way, in spite of
all opposition, at last. The end of the conflict was a total rejection of
authority and tradition, and the adoption of scientific truth.</p>

<p> <span class="side">Age of the earth.</span><span class="pag">[294]</span>  A victory
could not be more complete nor a triumph more brilliant than
that which had been gained by science in the contest concerning the
position of the earth. Though there followed closely thereupon an
investigation of scarcely inferior moment&mdash;that respecting the age of the
earth&mdash;so thoroughly was the ancient authority intellectually crushed
that it found itself incapable of asserting by force the Patristic idea
that our planet is less than six thousand years old.</p>


<p><span class="side">The question is impersonally solved.</span>Not but that a resistance was made. It was, however, of an indirect kind.
The contest might be likened rather to a partisan warfare than to the
deliberate movement of regular armies under recognized commanders. In its
history there is no <span class="pag">[295]</span> central <a id="figure295"></a>figure like Galileo, no representative man,
no brilliant and opportune event like the invention of the telescope. The
question moves on to its solution impersonally. A little advance is made
here by one, there by another. The war was finished, though no great
battle was fought. In the chapter we are entering upon there is,
therefore, none of that dramatic interest connected with the last.
Impersonally the question was decided, and, therefore, impersonally I
must describe it.</p>


<p><span class="side">Oriental and Western doctrines of the age of the earth.</span>In Oriental countries, where the popular belief assigns to the creation
of man a very ancient date, and even asserts for some empires a duration
of hundreds of thousands of years, no difficulty as respects the age of
the earth was felt, there seeming to have been time enough for every
event that human researches have detected to transpire. But in the West,
where the doctrine that not only the earth, but the universe itself, was
intended for man, has been carried to its consequences with exacting
rigour, circumstances forbid us to admit that there was any needless
delay between the preparation of the habitation and the introduction of
the tenant. They also force upon us the conclusion that a few centuries
constitute a very large portion of the time of human existence, since, if
we adopt the doctrine of an almost limitless period, we should fall into
a difficulty in explaining what has become of the countless myriads of
generations in the long time so past, and, considering that we are taught
that the end of the world is at hand, and must be expected in a few years
at the most, we might seem to arraign the goodness of God in this, that
He has left to their fate immeasurably the larger proportion of our race,
and has restricted His mercy to us alone, who are living in the departing
twilight of the evening of the world.</p>


<p><span class="side">Correction of the European doctrine.</span>But in this, as in the former case, a closer examination of the facts
brings us to the indisputable conclusion that we have decided unworthily
and untruly; that our guiding doctrine of the universe being intended for
us is a miserable delusion; that the scale on which the world is
constructed as to time answers to that on which it is constructed as to
space; that, <span class="pag">[296]</span> as <a id="respects296"></a>respects our planet, its origin dates from an epoch too
remote for our mental apprehension; that myriads of centuries have been
consumed in its coming to its present state; that, by a slow progression,
it has passed from stage to stage, uninhabited, and for a long time
uninhabitable by any living thing; that in their proper order and in due
lapse of time, the organic series have been its inhabitants, and of these
a vast majority, whose numbers are so great that we cannot offer an
intelligible estimate of them, have passed away and become extinct, and
that finally, for a brief period, we have been its possessors.</p>

<p>Of the intentions of God it becomes us, therefore, to speak with
reverence and reserve. In those ages when there was not a man upon the
earth, what was the object? Was the twilight only given that the wolf
might follow his fleeing prey, and the stars made to shine that the royal
tiger might pursue his midnight maraudings? Where was the use of so much
that was beautiful and orderly, when there was not a solitary
intellectual being to understand and enjoy? Even now, when we are so much
disposed to judge of other worlds from their apparent adaptedness to be
the abodes of a thinking and responsible order like ourselves, it may be
of service to remember that this earth itself was for countless ages a
dungeon of pestiferous exhalations and a den of wild beasts.</p>


<p><span class="side">It elevates rather than degrades the position of man.</span>It might moreover appear that the conclusions to which we come, both as
respects the position and age of the world, must necessarily have for
their consequences the diminution and degradation of man, the rendering
him too worthless an object for God's regard. But here again we fall into
an error. True, we have debased his animal value, and taught him how
little he is&mdash;how insignificant are the evils, how vain the pleasures of
his life. But, as respects his intellectual principle, how does the
matter stand? What is it that has thus been measuring the terrestrial
world, and weighing it in a balance? What is it that has been standing on
the sun, and marking out the orbits and boundaries of the solar system?
What is it that has descended into the infinite abysses of space,
examined the countless worlds that they contain, and compared and
contrasted <span class="pag">[297]</span> them <a id="together297"></a>together? What is it that has shown itself capable of
dealing with magnitudes that are infinite, even of comparing infinites
together! What is it that has not hesitated to trace things in their
history through a past eternity, and been found capable of regarding
equally the transitory moment and endless duration? That which is
competent to do all this, so far from being degraded, rises before us
with an air of surpassing grandeur and inappreciable worth. It is the
soul of man.</p>


<p><span class="side">Relations of the earth in time.</span>From the facts given in the last chapter respecting the relations of the
earth in space, we are next led to her relations in time.</p>

<p>So long as science was oppressed with the doctrine of the human destiny
of the universe, which, as its consequence, made this earth the great
central body, and elevated man to supreme importance, there was much
difficulty in treating the problem of the age of the world. The history
of the earth was at first a wild and fictitious cosmogony. Scientific
cosmogony arose, not from any theological considerations, but from the
telescopic ascertainment of the polar compression of the planet Jupiter,
and the consequent determination by Newton that the earth is a spheroid
of revolution. With a true cosmogony came a better chronology.
<span  class="side">Anthropocentric ideas of the beginning and end of the world.</span>
The patristic doctrine had been that the earth came into existence but little
more than five thousand years ago, and to this a popular opinion long
current was added, that its end might be very shortly expected. From time
to time periods were set by various authorities determining the latter
event, and, as true knowledge was extinguished, the year 1000 came to be
the universally appointed date. In view of this, it was not an uncommon
thing for persons to commence their testamentary bequests with the words,
"In expectation of the approaching end of the world." But the tremendous
moment passed by, and still the sun rose and set, still the seasons were
punctual in their courses, and Nature wore her accustomed aspect. A later
day was then predicted, and again and again disappointment ensued, until
sober-minded men began to perceive that the Scriptures were never
intended to give information on such subjects, and predictions <span class="pag">[298]</span> of <a id="the298"></a>the
end of the world fell into discredit, abandoned to the illiterate, whose
morbid anticipations they still amuse.</p>

<p>As it was thus with the end of our planet, so it was as regards her
origin. By degrees evidence began to accumulate casting a doubt on her
recent date, evidence continually becoming more and more cogent.
<span class="side">Rise of the doctrine of illimitable age.</span>
In no
insignificant manner did the establishment of the heliocentric theory,
aided by the discoveries of the telescope, assist in this result. As I
have said, it utterly ruined past restoration the doctrine of the human
destiny of the universe. With that went down all arguments which had
depended on making man the measure of things. Ideas of unexpected
sublimity as to the scale of magnitude on which the world is constructed
soon enforced themselves, and proved to be the precursors of similar
ideas as to time. At length it was perceived by those who were in the van
of the movement that the Bible was never intended to deliver a
chronological doctrine respecting the beginning any more than the end of
things, and that those well-meaning men who were occupied in wresting it
from its true purposes were engaged in an unhappy employment, for its
tendency could be no other than to injure the cause they designed to
promote. Nevertheless, so strong were the ancient persuasions, that it
was not without a struggle that the doctrine of a long period forced its
way&mdash;a struggle for the age of the earth, which, in its arguments, in its
tendencies, and in its results, forcibly recalls the preceding one
respecting the position of the earth; but, in the end, truth overrode all
authority and all opposition, and the doctrine of an extremely remote
origin of our planet ceased to be open to dispute.</p>

<p>In a scientific conception of the universe, illimitable spaces are of
necessity connected with limitless time.</p>


<p><span class="side">Indications depending on the progressive motion of light.</span>The discovery of the progressive motion of light offered the means of an
absolute demonstration of this connexion. Rays emitted by an object, and
making us sensible of its presence by impinging on the eye, do not reach
us instantaneously, but consume a certain period in their passage.</p>

<p>If any sudden visible effect took place in the sun, <span class="pag">[299]</span> we <a id="should299"></a>should not see it
at the absolute moment of its occurrence, but about eight minutes and
thirteen seconds later, this being the time required for light to cross
the intervening distance. All phenomena take place in reality anterior to
the moment at which we observe them by a time longer in proportion as the
distance to be travelled is greater.</p>

<p>There are objects in the heavens so distant that it would take many
hundreds of thousands of years for their light to reach us. Then it
necessarily follows, since we can see them, that they must have been
created and must have been shining so long.</p>

<p>The velocity with which light moves was first determined by the Danish
astronomer Römer from the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, November,
1675. It was, therefore, a determination of the rate for reflected solar
light in a vacuum, and gave 198,000 miles in a second. In 1727, Bradley
determined it for direct stellar light by his great discovery of the
aberration of the fixed stars. More recently, the experiments of M.
Foucault and those of M. Fizeau, by the aid of rotating mirrors or
wheels, have confirmed these astronomical observations, Fizeau's
determination of the velocity approaching that of Römer. Probably,
however, the most correct is that of Struve, 191,515 miles per second.</p>


<p><span class="side">Investigation of the age of the earth through the phenomena of heat.</span>This astronomical argument, which serves as a general introduction, is
strengthened by numerous physical and physiological facts. But of the
different methods by which the age of the earth may be elucidated, I
shall prefer that which approaches it through the phenomena of heat. Such
a manner of viewing the problem has led to its determination in the minds
of many thinking men.</p>


<p><span class="side">Astronomical heat alone on the earth's surface.</span>As correct astronomical ideas began to prevail, it was perceived that all
the heat now on the surface of our planet is derived from the sun.
Through the circumstance of the inclination of her axis of rotation to
the plane of her annual motion, or through the fact of her globular form
occasioning the presentation of different parts of her surface, according
to their latitudes, with more or less obliquity, and hence <span class="pag">[300]</span> the <a id="reception300"></a>reception
of less or more of the rays, there may be local and temporary variations.
But these do not affect the general principle that the quantity of heat
thus received must be the same from year to year.</p>


<p><span class="side">The equilibrium of interior heat.</span>This thermometric equilibrium not only holds good for the surface, it may
also be demonstrated for the whole mass of the planet. The day has not
shortened by the <sup class="topnum">1</sup>/<sup class="botnum">200</sup> of a second since the time of Hipparchus, and
therefore the decrease of heat can not have been so much as the <sup class="topnum">1</sup>/<sup class="botnum">300</sup> of
a Fahrenheit degree, on the hypothesis that the mean dilatation of all
terrestrial substances is equal to that of glass, <sup class="topnum">1</sup>/<sup class="botnum">180000</sup>
 for one
degree. If a decline had taken place in the intrinsic heat of the earth,
there must have been a diminution in her size, and, as a necessary
consequence, the length of the day must have become less. The earth has
therefore reached a condition of equilibrium as respects temperature.</p>


<p><span  class="side">Its ancient decline.</span>A vast body of evidence has, however, come into prominence, establishing
with equal certainty that there was in ancient times a far higher
temperature in the planet; not a temperature concerned with a fraction of
a degree, but ranging beyond the limits of our thermometric scale. The
mathematical figure of the earth offers a resistless argument for its
ancient liquefied condition&mdash;that is, for its originally high
temperature. But how is this to be co-ordinated with the conclusion just
mentioned? Simply by the admission that there have elapsed prodigious, it
might almost be said limitless, periods.
<span  class="side"> Necessity for a long time.</span>
As thus the true state of
affairs began to take on shape, it was perceived that the age of the
earth is not a question of authority, not a question of tradition, but a
mathematical problem sharply defined: to determine the time of cooling of
a globe of known diameter and of given conductibility by radiation in a
vacuum.</p>

<p>In such a state of things, what could be more unwise than to attempt to
force opinion by the exercise of authority? How unspeakably mischievous
had proved to be a like course as respects the globular form of the
earth, which did not long remain a mere mathematical abstraction, but was
abruptly brought to a practical issue by the voyage of Magellan's ship.
And on this question of <span class="pag">[301]</span> the <a id="age301"></a>age of the earth it would have been equally
unwise to become entangled with or committed to the errors of
patristicism&mdash;errors arising from well-meant moral considerations, but
which can never exert any influence on the solution of a scientific
problem.</p>


<p><span class="side">Indications of the interior heat of the earth.</span>One fact after another bearing upon the question gradually emerged into
view. It was shown that the diurnal variations of temperature&mdash;that is,
those connected with night and day&mdash;extend but a few inches beneath the
surface, the seasonal ones, connected with winter and summer, to many
feet; but beyond this was discovered a stratum of invariable temperature,
beneath which, if we descend, the heat increases at the rate of 1° Fahr.
for every fifty or seventy feet. The uniformity of this rate seemed to
imply that, at depths quite insignificant, a very high temperature must
exist. This was illustrated by such facts that the water which rushes up
from a depth of 1794 feet in the Artesian well of Grenelle has a
temperature of 82° Fahr. The mean temperature of Paris being about 51°
Fahr., these numbers give a rate of 1° for every fifty-eight feet. If,
then, the increase of heat is only 100° per mile, at a depth of less than
ten miles every thing must be red hot, and at thirty or forty in a melted
state. It was by all admitted that the rise of temperature with the depth
is not at all local, but occurs in whatever part of the earth the
observation may be made. The general conclusion thus furnished was
re-enforced by the evidence of volcanoes, which could no longer be
regarded as merely local, depending on restricted areas for the supply of
melted material, since they are found all over the land and under the
sea, in the interior of continents and near the shores, beneath the
equator and in the polar regions. It had been estimated that there are
probably two thousand aerial or subaqueous eruptions every century. Some
volcanoes, as Ætna, have for thousands of years poured forth their lavas,
and still there is an unexhausted supply. Everywhere a common source is
indicated by the rudely uniform materials ejected. The fact that the
lines of volcanic activity shift pointed to a deep source; the periodic
increments and decrements of force bore the same <span class="pag">[302]</span> interpretation. <a id="They302"></a>They
far transcend the range of history. The volcanoes of central France date
from the Eocene period; their power increased in the Miocene, and
continued through the Pliocene; those of Catalonia belong to the
Pliocene, probably. Coupled with volcanoes, earthquakes, with their
vertical, horizontal, and rotary vibrations, having a linear velocity of
from twenty to thirty miles per minute, indicated a profound focus of
action. The great earthquake of Lisbon was felt from Norway to Morocco,
from Algiers to the West Indies, from Thuringia to the Canadian lakes. It
absolutely lifted the whole bed of the North Atlantic Ocean. Its origin
was in no superficial point.</p>


<p><span class="side">Proof from the mean density.</span>A still more universal proof of a high temperature affecting the whole
mass of the interior of the globe was believed to be presented in the
small mean density of the earth, a density not more than 5·66 times that
of water, the mean density of the solid surface being 2·7, and that of
the solid and sea-surface together 1·6. But this is not a density
answering to that which the earth should have in virtue of the attraction
of her own parts. It implied some agent capable of rarefying and
dilating, and the only such agent is heat. Although the law of the
increase of density from the upper surface to the centre is unknown, yet
a comparison of the earth's compression with her velocity of rotation
demonstrated that there is an increasing density in the strata as we
descend. The great fact, however, which stands prominently forth is the
interior heat.</p>

<p>Not only were evidences thus offered of the existence of a high
temperature, and, therefore, of the lapse of a long time by the present
circumstances of the globe; every trace of its former state, duly
considered, yielded similar indications, the old evidence corroborating
the new. And soon it appeared that this would hold good whether
considered in the inorganic or organic aspect.</p>


<p><span class="side">Inorganic proofs of a former high temperature.</span>
In the inorganic, what other interpretation could be put on the universal
occurrence of igneous rocks, some in enormous mountain ranges, some
ejected from beneath, forcing their tortuous way through thus resisting
superincumbent strata; veins of <span class="pag">[303]</span> various <a id="mineral303"></a>mineral constitution, and, as
their relations with one another showed, veins of very different dates?
What other interpretation of layers of lava in succession, one under
another, and often with old disintegrated material between? What of those
numerous volcanoes which have never been known to show any signs of
activity in the period of history, though they sometimes occur in
countries like France, eminently historic? What meaning could be assigned
to all those dislocations, subsidences, and elevations which the crust of
the earth in every country presents, indications of a loss of heat, of a
contraction in diameter, and its necessary consequence, fracture of the
exterior consolidated shell along lines of least resistance? And though
it was asserted by some that the catastrophes of which these are the
evidences were occasioned by forces of unparalleled energy and incessant
operation&mdash;unparalleled when compared with such terrestrial forces as we
are familiar with&mdash;that did not, in any respect, change the
interpretation, for there could have been no abrupt diminution in the
intensity of those forces, which, if they had lessened in power, must
have passed through a long, a gradual decline.
<span class="side">These necessarily imply long time.</span>
 In that very decline there
thus spontaneously came forth evidences of a long lapse of time. The
whole course of Nature satisfies us how gradual and deliberate are her
proceedings; that there is no abrupt boundary between the past and the
present, but that the one insensibly shades off into the other, the
present springing gently and imperceptibly out of the past. If volcanic
phenomena and all kinds of igneous manifestations&mdash;if dislocations,
injections, the intrusion of melted material into strata were at one time
more frequent, more violent&mdash;if, in the old times, mundane forces
possessed an energy which they have now lost, their present diminished
and deteriorated condition, coupled with the fact that for thousands of
years, throughout the range of history, they have been invariably such as
we find them now, should be to us a proof how long, how very long ago
those old times must have been.</p>

<p>Thus, therefore, was perceived the necessity of co-ordinating the scale
of time with the scale of space, and such views of the physical history
of the earth were <span class="pag">[304]</span> extended <a id="to304"></a>to celestial bodies which were considered as
having passed through a similar course. In one, at least, this assertion
was no mere matter of speculation, but of actual observation.
<span class="side">Support from astronomical facts.</span>
 The broken
surface of the moon, its volcanic cones and craters, its mountains, with
their lava-clad sides and ejected blocks glistening in the sun, proved a
succession of events like those of the earth, and demonstrated that there
is a planetary as well as a terrestrial geology, and that in our
satellite there is evidence of a primitive high temperature, of a gradual
decline, and, therefore, of a long process of time. Perhaps also,
considering the rate of heat-exchange in Venus by reason of her proximity
to the sun, the pale light which it is said has been observed on her
non-illuminated part is the declining trace of her own intrinsic
temperature, her heat lasting until now.</p>


<p><span class="side">Astronomical facts imply slow secular changes.</span>If astronomers sought in systematic causes an explanation of these facts
if, for instance, they were disposed to examine how far changes in the
obliquity of the ecliptic are connected therewith&mdash;it was necessary at
the outset to concede that the scale of time on which the event proceeds
is of prodigious duration, this secular variation observing a slow
process of only 45·7'' in a century; and hence, since the time of
Hipparchus, two thousand years ago, the plane of the ecliptic has
approached that of the equator by only a quarter of a degree. Or if,
again, they looked to a diminishing of the eccentricity of the earth's
orbit, they were compelled to admit the same postulate, and deal with
thousands of centuries. Under whatever aspect, then, the theory was
regarded, if once a former high temperature were admitted, and the fact
coupled therewith that there has been no sensible decline within the
observation of man, whether the explanation was purely geological or
purely astronomical, the motion of heat in the mass of the earth is so
slow, yet the change that has taken place is so great, the variations of
the contemplated relations of the solar system so gradual&mdash;under whatever
aspect and in whatever way the fact was dealt with, there arose the
indispensable concession of countless centuries.</p>

<p>To the astronomer such a concession is nothing <span class="pag">[305]</span> extraordinary. <a id="It305"></a>It is not
because of the time required that he entertains any doubt that the sun
and his system accomplish a revolution round a distant centre of gravity
in nineteen millions of years, or that the year of epsilon Lyræ is
half a million of ours. He looks forward to that distant day when Sirius
will disappear from our skies, and the Southern Cross be visible, and
Vega the polar star. He looks back to the time when gamma Draconis
occupied that conspicuous position, and the builders of the great
pyramid, <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 3970, gave to its subterranean passage an inclination of
26° 15´, corresponding to the inferior culmination of that star. He tells
us that the Southern Cross began to be invisible in 52° 30´ N., 2900
years before our era, and that it had previously attained an altitude of
more than 10°. When it disappeared from the horizon of the countries on
the Baltic, the pyramid of Cheops had been erected more than a thousand
years.</p>


<p><span class="side">Proofs of time from aqueous effects,</span>We must pass by a copious mass of evidence furnished by aqueous causes of
change operating on the earth's surface, though these add very weighty
proof to the doctrine of a long period. The filling up of lakes, the
formation of deltas, the cutting power of running water, the deposit of
travertines, the denudation of immense tracts of country, the carrying of
their detritus into the sea, the changes of shores by tides and waves,
the formation of strata hundreds of miles in length, and the imbedding
therein of fossil remains in numbers almost beyond belief, furnished many
interesting and important facts. Of these not a few presented means of
computation. It would not be difficult to assign a date for such
geographical events as the production of the Caspian and Dead Seas from
an examination of the sum of saline material contained in their waters
and deposited in their bed, with the annual amount brought into them by
their supplying rivers. Such computations were executed as respects the
growth of Lower Egypt and the backward cutting of Niagara Falls, and,
though they might be individually open to criticism, their mutual
accordance and tendency furnished an evidence that could not be gainsaid.
The continual accumulation of such evidence ought not to be without its
weight on those who are still disposed to <span class="pag">[306]</span> treat <a id="slightingly306"></a>slightingly the power of
geological facts in developing truth.</p>


<p><span class="side">and from the movements of the earth's crust.</span>To such facts were added all those, with which volumes might be filled,
proving the universality of the movements of the solid crust of the
earth&mdash;strata once necessarily horizontal now inclined at all angles,
strata unconformable to one another&mdash;a body of evidence most copious and
most satisfactory, yet demonstrating from the immensity of the results
how slowly the work had gone on.</p>

<p>How was it possible to conceive that beds many hundred feet in thickness
should have been precipitated suddenly from water? Their mechanical
condition implied slow disintegration and denudation in other localities
to furnish material; their contents showed no trace of violence; they
rather proved the deposition to have occurred in a tranquil and quiet
way. What interpretation could be put upon facts continually increasing
in number like those observed in the south-east of England, where
fresh-water beds a thousand feet thick are covered by other beds a
thousand feet thick, but of marine origin? What upon those in the north
of England, where masses once uplifted a thousand feet above the level,
and, at the time of their elevation, presenting abrupt precipices and
cliffs of that height, as is proved by the fractures and faults of the
existing strata, have been altogether removed, and the surface left
plain? In South Wales there are localities where 11,000 feet in thickness
have been bodily carried away. Whether, therefore, the strata that have
been formed, and which remain to strike us with astonishment at their
prodigious mass, were considered; or those that have been destroyed, not,
however, without leaving unmistakable traces of themselves; the processes
of wearing away to furnish material as well as the accumulation, of
necessity required the lapse of long periods of time. The undermining of
cliffs by the beating of the sea, the redistribution of sands and mud at
the bottom of the ocean, the washing of material from hills into the
lowlands by showers of rain, its transport by river courses, the
disintegration of soils by the influence of frost, the weathering of
rocks by carbonic acid, and the solution of limestone by its aid in
water&mdash;these are effects <span class="pag">[307]</span> which, <a id="even307"></a>even at the quickest, seem not to amount
to much in the course of the life of a man. A thousand years could yield
but a trifling result.</p>

<p>We have already alluded to another point of view from which these
mechanical effects were considered. The level of the land and sea has
unmistakably changed. There are mountain eminences ten or fifteen
thousand feet in altitude in the interior of continents over which, or
through which shells and other products of the sea are profusely
scattered. And though, considering the proverbial immobility of the solid
land and the proverbial instability of the water, it might at first be
supposed much more likely that the sea had subsided than that the land
had risen, a more critical examination soon led to a change of opinion.
Before our eyes, in some countries, elevations and depressions are taking
place, sometimes in a slow secular manner, as in Norway and Sweden, that
peninsula on the north rising, and on the south sinking, at such a rate
that, to accomplish the whole seven hundred feet of movement, more than
twenty-seven thousand years would be required if it had always been
uniform as now. Elsewhere, as on the south-western coast of South
America, the movement is paroxysmal, the shore line lifting for hundreds
of miles instantaneously, and then pausing for many years. In the Morea
also, range after range of old sea cliffs exist, some of them more than a
thousand feet high, with terraces at the base of each; but the Morea has
been well known for the last twenty-five centuries, and in that time has
undergone no material change. Again, in Sicily, similar interior
sea-cliffs are seen, the rubbish at their bases containing the bones of
the hippopotamus and mammoth, proofs of the great change the climate has
undergone since the sea washed those ancient beaches. Italy,
pre-eminently the historic country, in which, within the memory of man,
no material change of configuration has taken place since the Pleistocene
period, very late geologically speaking has experienced elevations of
fifteen hundred feet. The seven hills of Rome are of the Pliocene, with
fluviatile deposits and recent terrestrial shells two hundred feet above
the Tiber. There intervened between the older Pliocene and the newer a
period of enormous length, as is <span class="pag">[308]</span> demonstrated <a id="by308"></a>by the accumulated effects
taking place in it, and, indeed, the same may be said of every juxtaposed
pair of distinctly marked strata. It demanded an inconceivable time for
beds once horizontal at the bottom of the sea to be tilted to great
inclinations; it required also the enduring exertion of a prodigious
force. Ascent and descent may be detected in strata of every age:
movements sometimes paroxysmal, but more often of tranquil and secular
kind. The coal-bearing strata, by gradual submergence, attained in South
Wales a thickness of 12,000 feet, and in Nova Scotia, a total thickness
of 14,570 feet; the uniformity of the process of submergence and its slow
steadiness is indicated by the occurrence of erect trees at different
levels: seventeen such repetitions may be counted in a thickness of 4515
feet. The age of the trees is proved by their size, some being four feet
in diameter. Round them, as they gradually went down with the subsiding
soil, calamites grew at one level after another. In the Sidney coal-field
fifty-nine fossil forests thus occur in superposition.</p>


<p><span class="side">Organic proofs of a former high temperature.</span>Such was the conclusion forcing itself from considerations connected with
inorganic nature. It received a most emphatic endorsement from the
organic world, for there is an intimate connexion between the existence
and well-being both of plants and animals, and the heat to which they are
exposed. Why is it that the orange and lemon do not grow in New York?
What is it that would inevitably ensue if these exotics were exposed to a
cold winter? What must take place if, in Florida or other of the Southern
states, a season of unusual rigor should occur? Does not heat thus
confine within a fixed boundary the spread of these plants? And so,
again, how many others there are which grow luxuriantly in a temperate
climate, but are parched up and killed if fortuitously carried beneath a
hot tropical sun. To every one there is a climate which best suits the
condition of its life, and certain limits of heat and cold beyond which
its existence is not possible.</p>

<p>If the mean annual heat of the earth's surface were slowly to rise, and,
in the course of some centuries, the temperature now obtaining in Florida
should obtain in New York, the orange and lemon would certainly be found
here.
<span class="side">Boundary of organisms by heat.</span>
 <span class="pag">[309]</span> <a id="With309"></a>With the increasing heat those plants would commence a northward march,
steadily advancing as opportunity was given. Or, if the reverse took
place, and for any reason the heat of the torrid zone declined until the
winter's cold of New York should be at last reached under the equator, as
the descent went on the orange and lemon would retreat within a narrow
and narrower region, and end by becoming extinct, the conditions of their
exposure being incompatible with the continuance of their life. From such
considerations it is therefore obvious that not only does heat arrange
the limits of the distribution of plants, erecting round them boundaries
which, though invisible, are more insuperable than a wall of brass, it
also regulates their march, if march there is to be&mdash;nay, even controls
their very existence, and to genera, and species, and individuals
appoints a period of duration.</p>


<p><span class="side">Animals localized as well as plants.</span>Such observations apply not alone to plants; the animal kingdom offers
equally significant illustrations. Why does the white bear enjoy the
leaden sky of the pole and his native iceberg? Why does the tiger
restrict himself to the jungles of India? Can it be doubted that, if the
mean annual temperature should decline, the polar bear would come with
his iceberg to corresponding southern latitudes, or, if the heat should
rise, the tiger would commence a northward journey? Does he not, indeed,
every summer penetrate northward in Asia as far as the latitude of
Berlin, and retire again as winter comes on? Why is it that, at a given
signal, the birds of passage migrate, pressed forward in the spring by
the heat, and pressed backward in the autumn by the cold? The annual
migration of birds illustrates the causes of geological appearances and
extinctions. Do we not herein recognize the agent that determines animal
distribution? We must not deceive ourselves with any fancied terrestrial
impediment or restraint. Let the heat rise but a few degrees, and the
turkey-buzzard, to whose powerful wing distances are of no moment and the
free air no impediment, would be seen hovering over New York; let it fall
a few degrees, and he would vanish from the streets of Charleston; let it
fall a little more, and he would vanish from <span class="pag">[310]</span> the <a id="earth310"></a>earth. Shell-fish, once
the inhabitants of the British seas, retired during the glacial period to
the Mediterranean, and with the returning warmth have gone back northward
again.</p>


<p><span class="side">Control of animals by food.</span>Animals are thus controlled by heat in an indirect as well as a direct
way. Indirectly; for, if their food be diminished, they must seek a more
ample supply; if it fails, they must perish. Doubtless it was
insufficient food, as well as the setting in of a more rigorous climate,
that occasioned the destruction of the mastodon giganteus, which abounded
in the United States after the drift period. Such great elephantine forms
could not possibly sustain themselves against the rigors of the present
winters, nor could they find a sufficient supply of food for a
considerable portion of the year. The disappearance of animals from the
face of the earth was, as Palæontology advanced, ascertained to have been
a determinate process, a condition of their existence, and either
inherent in themselves or dependent on their environment. It was proved
that the forms now existing are only an insignificant part of the
countless tribes that have lived.
<span class="side">Nature of creations and extinctions.</span>
The earth has been the theatre of a
long succession of appearances and removals, of creations and
extinctions, reaching to the latest times. In the Pleistocene of Sicily,
<sup class="topnum">35</sup>/<sup class="botnum">124</sup> of the fossil shells are extinct; in the bone caverns of England,
out of thirty-seven mammals eighteen are extinct. But judging, from what
may be observed of the duration of races contemporary with us, that their
life is prolonged for thousands of years, successive generations of the
same species in a long order replacing their predecessors before final
removal occurs, this again resistlessly brought forward the same
conclusion to which all the foregoing facts had pointed, that there have
transpired since the introduction of animal life upon this globe very
long periods of time.</p>

<p>Through the operation of this law of extinction and of creation, animated
nature, both on the continents and in the seas, has undergone a
marvellous change. In the lias and oolitic seas, the Enaliosauria,
Cetiosauria, and Crocodilia dominated as the Delphinidæ and Balænidæ do
in ours; the former have been eliminated, the latter <span class="pag">[311]</span> produced. <a id="Along311"></a>Along
with the cetaceans came the soft-scaled Cycloid and Ctenoid fishes,
orders which took the place of the Ganoids and Placoids of the Mesozoic
times. One after another successive species of air-breathing reptiles
have emerged, continued for their appointed time to exist, and then died
out. The development has been, not in the descending, but in the
ascending order; the Amphitheria, Spalacotheria, Triconodon of the
Mesozoic times were substituted by higher tertiary forms. Nor have these
mutations been abrupt. If mammals are the chief characteristic of the
Tertiary ages, their first beginnings are seen far earlier; in the
triassic and oolitic formations there are a few of the lower orders
struggling, as it were, to emerge. The aspect of animated nature has
altogether changed. No longer does the camelopard wander over Europe as
he did in the Miocene and Pliocene times; no longer are great elephants
seen in the American forests, the hippopotamus in England, the Rhinoceros
in Siberia. The hand of man has introduced in the New the horse of the
Old World; but the American horse, that ran on the great plains
contemporary with the megatherium and megalonyx, has for tens of
thousands of years been extinct. Even the ocean and the rivers are no
exception to these changes.</p>


<p><span class="side">Creations and extinctions by law.</span>What, then, is the manner of origin of this infinite succession of forms?
It is often sufficient to see clearly a portion of a plan to be able to
determine with some degree of certainty the general arrangement of the
whole; it is often sufficient to know with precision a part of the life
of an individual to guess with probable accuracy his action in some
forthcoming event, of to determine the share he has borne in affairs that
are past. It is enough to appreciate thoroughly the style of a master to
ascertain without doubt the authenticity of an imputed picture. And so,
in the affairs of the universe, it is enough to ascertain the manner of
operation of a part in order to settle the manner of operation of the
whole. When, therefore, it was perceived how the disappearance of
vanishing forms from the surface of the globe is accomplished&mdash;that it is
not by a sudden and grand providential intervention&mdash;that there is no
visible putting <span class="pag">[312]</span> forth <a id="of312"></a>of the Omnipotent hand, but slowly and silently,
yet surely, the ordinary laws of Nature are permitted to take their
course&mdash;that heat, and cold, and want of food, and dryness, and moisture,
in the end, as if by an irresistible destiny, accomplish the event, it
seemed to indicate that, as regards the introduction of new-comers, a
suitableness of external conditions had called them forth, as an
unsuitableness could end them. Changes in the constitution of the air or
its pressure, in the composition of the sea or its depth, in the
brilliancy of light or the amount of heat, in the inorganic material of a
medium, will modify old forms into new ones, or compel their extinction.
Birth and death go hand in hand; creation and extinction are inseparable.
The variation of organic form is continuous; it depends upon an orderly
succession of material events; appearances and eliminations are managed
upon a common principle; they stand connected with the irresistible
course of great mundane changes. It was impossible that geologists could
reach any other conclusion than that such phenomena are not the issue of
direct providential interventions, but of physical influences. The
procession of organic life is not a motley march; it follows the
procession of physical events; and, since it is impossible to
re-establish a sameness of physical conditions that have once come to an
end, or reproduce the order in which they have occurred, it of necessity
follows that no organic form can reappear after it has once died
out&mdash;once dead, it is clean gone for ever.</p>


<p><span class="side">Interstitial molecular creations.</span>In the course of the life of individual man, the parts that constitute
his system are undergoing momentary changes; those of to-day are not the
same as those of yesterday, and they will be replaced by others
to-morrow. There have been, and are every instant, interstitial deaths of
all the constituent particles, and an unceasing removal of those that
have performed their duty. In the stead of departing portions, new ones
have been introduced, interstitial births and organizations perpetually
taking place. In physiology it became no longer a question that all this
proceeds in a determinate way under the operation of principles that are
fixed, of laws that are invariable. The alchemists <span class="pag">[313]</span> introduced <a id="no313"></a>no
poetical fiction when they spoke of the microcosm, asserting that the
system of man is emblematical of the system of the world. The
intercalation of a new organic molecule in a living being answers to the
introduction of a new form in the universal organic series. It requires
as much power to call into existence a living molecule as to produce a
living being. Both are accomplished upon the same principle, and that
principle is not an incessant intervention of a supernatural kind, but
the operation of unvarying law. Physical agents, working through physical
laws, remove in organisms such molecules as have accomplished their work
and create new ones, and physical agents, working through physical laws,
control the extinctions and creations of forms in the universe of life.
The difference is only in the time. What is accomplished in the one case
in the twinkling of an eye, in the other may demand the lapse of a
thousand centuries.</p>

<p>The variation of organic forms, under the force of external
circumstances, is thus necessary to be understood in connexion with that
countless succession of living beings demonstrated by geology. It carries
us, in common with so much other evidence, to the lapse of a long time.
Nor are such views as those to which we are thus constrained inconsistent
with the admission of a Providential guidance of the world. Man, however
learned and pious he may be, is not always a trustworthy interpreter of
the ways of God. In deciding whether any philosophical doctrine is
consistent or inconsistent with the Divine attributes, we are too prone
to judge of those attributes by our own finite and imperfect standard,
forgetting that the only test to which we ought to resort is the
ascertainment if the doctrine be true. If it be true, it is in unison
with God. Perhaps some who have rejected the conception of the variation
of organic forms, with its postulate&mdash;limitless duration, may have failed
to remember the grandeur of the universe and its relations to space and
to time; perhaps they do not recall the system on which it is
administered. Like the anthropomorphite monks of the Nile, they conceive
of God as if he were only a very large man; else how could it for a
moment have been doubted that it is far more&mdash;I use the expression
<span class="pag">[314]</span> reverently&mdash;in <a id="the314"></a>the style of the great Constructor to carry out his
intentions by the summary operations of law?
<span class="side">Defence of the process of all things by law.</span>
It might be consistent with
the weakness and ignorance of man to be reduced to the necessity of
personal intervention for the accomplishment of his plans, but would not
that be the very result of such ignorance? Does not absolute knowledge
actually imply procedure by preconceived and unvarying law? Is not
momentary intervention altogether derogatory to the thorough and absolute
sovereignty of God? The astronomical calculation of ancient events, as
well as the prediction of those to come, is essentially founded on the
principle that there has not in the times under consideration, and that
there will never be in the future, any exercise of an arbitrary or
overriding will. The cornerstone of astronomy is this, that the solar
system&mdash;nay, even the universe, is ruled by necessity. To operate by
expedients is for the creature, to operate by law for the Creator; and so
far from the doctrine that creations and extinctions are carried on by a
foreseen and predestined ordinance&mdash;a system which works of itself
without need of any intermeddling&mdash;being an unworthy, an ignoble
conception, it is completely in unison with the resistless movements of
the mechanism of the universe, with whatever is orderly, symmetrical, and
beautiful upon earth, and with all the dread magnificence of the heavens.</p>


<p><span class="side">Historical sketch of early Palæontology.</span>It was in Italy that particular attention was first given to organic
remains. Leonardo da Vinci asserts that they are real shells, or the
remains thereof, and hence that the land and sea must have changed their
relative position. At this time fossils were looked upon as rare
curiosities, no one supposing that they were at all numerous, and many
were the fantastic hypotheses proposed to account for their occurrence.
Some referred them to the general deluge mentioned in Scripture; some to
a certain plastic power obscurely attributed to the earth; some thought
that they were engendered by the sunlight, heat, and rain. To Da Vinci is
due the first clear assertion of their true nature, that they are
actually the remains of organic beings. Soon the subject was taken up by
other eminent Italians. Fracaster wrote on the petrifactions <span class="pag">[315]</span> of <a id="Verona315"></a>Verona;
Scilla, a Sicilian, on marine bodies turned into stone, illustrating his
work by engravings. Still later, Vallisneri, 1721, published letters on
marine bodies found in rocks, attempting by their aid to determine the
extent of the marine deposits of Italy. These early cultivators of
geology soon perceived the advantage to be gained by the establishment of
museums and the publication of catalogues. The first seems to have been
that of John Kentman, an example that was followed by Calceolarius and
Vallisneri. Subsequently Fontanelle proposed the construction of charts
in accordance with fossil remains; but the principle involved was not
applied on the great scale as a true geological test until introduced by
Smith in connexion with the English strata.</p>


<p><span class="side">The pre-organic time. </span>To Steno, a Dane, is due the recognition of pre-organic in
contradistinction to organic rocks, a distinction the terms of which
necessarily involve the idea of time. Soon it became generally recognized
that the strata in which organic remains occur are of a later date than
those devoid of them, the pre-organic rocks demonstrating a pre-organic
time. Moreover, as facts were developed, it was plain that there are
essential differences in the relations of fossils, and that, though in
Italy the same species of shells may occur in the mountains that occur in
the adjacent seas, this was very far from being the case uniformly
elsewhere. At length the truth began to emerge, that in proportion as the
strata under examination are of an older date, so are the differences
between their organic remains and existing species more marked. It was
also discovered that the same species often extends superficially over
immense districts, but that in a vertical examination one species after
another rapidly appears in a descending order&mdash;an order which could be
verified in spite of the contortions, fractures, and displacements of the
strata. A very important theoretical conclusion was here presented: for
the rapid succession of essentially different organic forms, as the rocks
were older, was clearly altogether inconsistent with one catastrophe, as
the universal deluge, to which it had been generally referred. It was
plain that the thickness of the strata in which they were enveloped, and
the prodigious numbers in which <span class="pag">[316]</span> they <a id="occurred316"></a>occurred, answered in some degree
to the period of life of those fossils, since every one of them, large or
small, must have had its time of birth, of maturity, and of death.
<span class="side">Insufficiency of a single catastrophe.</span>
When, therefore, it could be no longer doubted that strata many hundreds of
feet in thickness were crowded with such remains, it became altogether
out of the question to refer their entombment to the confusion of a
single catastrophe, for every thing indicated an orderly and deliberate
proceeding. Still more cogent did this evidence become when, in a more
critical manner, the fossils were studied, and some strata were
demonstrated to be of a fresh-water and others of a marine origin, the
one intercalated with the other like leaves in a book. To this fact may
be imputed the final overthrow of the doctrine of a single catastrophe,
and its replacement by a doctrine of periodical changes.</p>


<p><span class="side">The orderly progression of organization.</span>From these statements it will therefore be understood that, commencing
with the first appearance of organization, an orderly process was
demonstrated from forms altogether unlike those with which we are
familiar, up to those at present existing, a procedure conducted so
slowly that it was impossible to assign for it a shorter duration than
thousands of centuries. Moreover, it seemed that the guiding condition
which had controlled this secular march of organization was the same
which still determines the possibility of existence and the distribution
of life. The succession of organic forms indicates a clear relation to a
descending temperature. The plants of the earliest times are plants of an
ultratropical climate, and that primitive vegetation seemed to
demonstrate that there had been a uniform climate&mdash;a climate of high
temperature&mdash;all over the globe. The coal-beds of Nova Scotia exhibited
the same genera and species as those of Europe, and so well marked was
the botanical connexion with the declining temperature in successive ages
that attempts were made to express eras by their prevailing organisms;
thus Brongniart's division is, for the Primary strata, the Age of
Acrogens; the Secondary, exclusive of the Cretaceous, the Age of
Gymnogens; the third, including the Cretaceous and Tertiary, the Age of
Angiosperms. It is to be particularly remarked that<span class="pag">[317]</span> the <a id="Cretaceous317"></a>Cretaceous
flora, in the aggregate, combines the antecedent and succeeding periods,
proving that the change was not by crisis or sudden catastrophe, but that
the new forms rose gently among the old ones. After the Eocene period,
dicotyledonous angiosperms became the prevalent form, and from that date
to the Pleistocene the evidences of a continued refrigeration are
absolute.</p>


<p><span class="side">Climates in time and in place.</span>As thus an examination was made from the most ancient to the later ages,
indications were found of a climate arrangement more and more
distinct&mdash;in the high latitudes, from the ultratropical through the
tropical, the temperate, down to the present frigid state; in lower
latitudes the declining process stopping short at an earlier point. It
therefore appeared that there has been a production of climates both in
an order of time and, in an order of locality, the greatest change having
occurred in the frigid zone, which has passed through all mean
temperatures, an intermediate change in the temperate, and a minimum in
the torrid zone. The general effect has thus been to present a succession
of surfaces on the same planet adapted to a varied organization, and
offering a more magnificent spectacle than if we were permitted to
inspect many different planets; for in them there might be no necessary
connexion of their forms of life, but in this there is, so that, were our
knowledge of Comparative Physiology more perfect, we might amuse
ourselves with intercalating among the plant and animal organisms
familiar to us hypothetical forms that would make the series complete,
and verify our principles by their subsequent discovery in the deep
strata of the earth.</p>

<p>Does not this progression of life in our planet suggest a like
progression for the solar system, which in its aggregate is passing in
myriads of years through all organic phases? May we not also, from our
solar system, rise to a similar conception for the universe?</p>

<p>There are two very important considerations, on which we must dwell for
the complete understanding of the consequences of these changes: 1st. The
mechanism of the declining temperature; 2d. Its effect in the organic
world.</p>



<p><span class="side">The nature of terrestrial declining temperature.</span>1st. A uniformly high temperature could never <span class="pag">[318]</span> be <a id="manifested318"></a>manifested all over the
surface of our planet through any heating influence of the sun. A high
and uniform temperature unerringly points to an internal cause; and the
gradual appearance of climates, manifesting a relatively increasing power
of the sun, indicates the slow diminution of that internal heat. But this
is precisely the conclusion which was come to from a contemplation of the
earth from a purely physical point of view. So long as its intrinsic heat
overpowered that derived from the sun, it was not possible that any thing
answering to climates could be established; and, until a certain degree
of cooling by radiation had been accomplished, the heat must have been
comparatively uniform in all latitudes; but, that point gained, there
necessarily ensued an arrangement of zones of different temperatures, or,
in other words, climates appeared, the process being essentially slow,
and becoming slower as the loss of heat went on. Finally, when loss of
heat from the earth ceased, an equilibrium was reached in the climate
arrangement as we now find it. Thus purely physical as well as geological
considerations brought philosophers on this point to the same
conclusion&mdash;that conclusion which has been so often repeated&mdash;very long
periods of time.</p>


<p><span class="side">Consequent effect on the Flora and Fauna.</span>2nd. As to the effect on the organic world. Nothing can live at a
temperature higher than the boiling-point of water, for the condition of
life implies that there shall circulate from part to part of a living
mechanism a watery liquid, sap, or blood. From this it necessarily
follows that a planet, the temperature of which is above a certain limit,
must necessarily have a lifeless surface; and this seemed to be the
interpretation of that pre-organic time to which we have referred.
Moreover, when the temperature suitably descends so as to come within the
limit at which life is possible, its uniformity over the surface of a
planet will produce a sameness in the organization. It would be an
identity if heat were the only regulating condition of life. At this
stage of things, the solar heat being overpowered, and a sensibly uniform
temperature in all latitudes existing, still the only possible organic
forms are those consistent with a high temperature, uniformity in the
physical <span class="pag">[319]</span> condition <a id="impressing319"></a>impressing a general uniformity in the aspect of life
geographically.
<span class="side">Production and distribution of new organisms.</span>
But the moment that climate arrangement has become
possible, variety of organic form becomes possible. Now also ensues
another all-important result&mdash;geographical distribution. Both of plants
and animals, those whose vital conditions are inconsistent with the
occurring change must retire from the affected locality. In plants this
retrocession is brought to pass by the gradual sickening and death of
individuals, or the impossibility of reproduction; in animals there is
added thereto, because of their power of locomotion, voluntary
retirement, at least in the case of individuals, and immobility in the
species is corrected by locomotion in the individual. The affected region
has become unsuitable, cheerless, uncomfortable; they abandon it; and as
the boundary they thus, in the one case, can not, and in the other will
not overpass, advances, so do they recede before it. If the change were
abrupt, or took place by a sudden crisis, there would seem to be no other
possible event than an overcrowding of the unaffected region and a
desolation of the part that had varied. But, since a developing cell
under a new condition produces a new form, and since the physical change
is taking place with extreme slowness, the appearance of modified
structures ensues. And thus, by decline of temperature, two distinct
results are accomplished&mdash;first the production of organic forms in an
order of succession, new ones replacing the old, as if they were
transmutations of them, and, secondly, geographical distribution.</p>


<p><span class="side">Delusive nature of organic equilibrium.</span>In my "Physiology" I have endeavoured to explain in detail the principles
here set forth. I have endeavoured to show that the aspect of sameness
presented by an animal or plant is no proof of unchangeability. Those
forms retain in our times their special aspect because the conditions of
the theatre in which they live do not change; but let the mean
temperature rise, let the sun-rays become brighter, change the
composition of the air, and forthwith the world of organization would
show how profoundly it was affected. Nor need such changes, in one sense,
be more than insignificant to produce prodigious results. Thus the air
contains only <span class="pag">[320]</span> <sup class="topnum">1</sup>/<sup class="botnum">2000</sup> <a id="of320"></a>of its volume of carbonic acid gas. That apparently
trifling quantity taken away, in an instant the whole surface of the
earth would become a desolate waste, without the possibility of vegetable
life.</p>


<p><span class="side">The Coal period.</span>As physical geology advanced, the Coal period was perceived to be the
chief epoch in the history of our planet. Through a slow decline of
temperature, a possibility had gradually been attained, so far as the
condition of heat was concerned, for a luxuriant vegetable growth. All
that prodigious mass of carbon now found in the earth in the various
forms of coal existed as carbonic acid in the atmosphere. The proportion
of free oxygen was less than at present by a volume equal to the excess
of carbonic acid.
<span class="side">Effects of light on the atmosphere,</span>
A change in the constitution of this primæval
atmosphere was occasioned by the action of the light; for, under the
influence of the sun-rays, plants decompose carbonic acid, appropriating
its carbon, and, for the most part, setting the oxygen free. The quantity
of carbon which can thus be condensed for the use of a plant, and,
indeed, every such decomposing action by light, is directly proportionate
to the quantity of light consumed, as experiments which I have personally
made have proved. For the production of so great a weight of combustible
matter a very long period of time was necessarily required, that the sun
might supply the necessary luminous influence.</p>

<p>Age after age the sunbeams continued their work, changing the mechanical
relations and composition of the atmosphere, the constitution of the sea,
and the appearance of the surface of the earth. There was a prodigious
growth of ferns, lepidodendra, equisetaceæ, coniferæ. The percentage of
oxygen in the air continually increased, that of carbonic acid
continually declined; the pressure of the air correspondingly diminished,
partly because of the replacement of a heavy gas by a lighter one, and
partly because of the general decline of temperature slowly taking place,
which diminished the absolute volume of vapour.
<span class="side"> and also on the sea.</span>
The sea, in its deepest
abysses, was likewise affected by the sunlight; not directly, but in an
indirect way; for, as the removal of carbonic acid from the atmosphere
went on, portions of that gas were <span class="pag">[321]</span> perpetually <a id="surrendered321"></a>surrendered by the ocean
in order to maintain a diffusion-equilibrium between its dissolved gas
and the free gas of the air. And now no longer could be held in
transparent solution by the water those great quantities of carbonate of
lime which had once been concealed in it, the deposit of a given weight
of coal in the earth being inevitably followed by the deposit of an
equivalent weight of carbonate of lime in the sea. This might have taken
place as an amorphous precipitate; but the probabilities were that it
would occur, as in fact it did, under forms of organization in the great
limestone strata coeval with and posterior to the coal. The air and the
ocean were thus suffering an invisible change through the disturbing
agency of the sun, and the surface of the solid earth was likewise
undergoing a more manifest, and, it may be said, more glorious
alteration. Plants, in wild luxuriance, were developing themselves in the
hot and dank climate, and the possibility was now approaching for the
appearance of animal types very much higher than any that had yet
existed.
<span class="side"> Cold-blooded animals succeeded by hot.</span>
In the old heavy atmosphere, full of a noxious gas, none but
slowly-respiring cold-blooded animals could maintain themselves; but
after the great change in the constitution of the air had been
accomplished, the quickly-respiring and hot-blooded forms might exist.
Hitherto the highest advancement that animal life could reach was in
batrachian and lizard-like organisms; yet even these were destined to
participate in the change, increasing in magnitude and vital capacity.
The pterodactyl of the chalk, a flying lizard, measures nearly seventeen
feet from tip to tip of its wings. The air had now become suitable for
mammals, both placental and implacental, and for birds. One after
another, in their due order, appeared the highest vertebrates: marine, as
the cetacean; aerial, as the bat; and in the terrestrial, reaching, in
the Eocene, quadrumanous animals, but not, until after the Pliocene, man.</p>


<p><span class="side">The date of organisms may change, but the order not.</span>Although the advance of geology may hereafter lead to a correction of
some of the conclusions thus attained to respecting the first dates of
different organic forms, and carry them back to more ancient times, it is
scarcely likely that <span class="pag">[322]</span> any <a id="material322"></a>material modification of their order of
occurrence will ever be made. Birds, mammals, reptiles, fishes, and
invertebrates may each be detected in earlier strata; even in some of
those formations now regarded as non-fossiliferous, organisms may be
found; but it is not at all probable that the preponderance of reptiles
will ever cease to be the essential characteristic of the Secondary
rocks, or that of mammals of the Tertiary, or that a preceding period of
vast duration, in which the type of life had been the invertebrate, will
ever be doubted. Nothing, probably, will ever be discovered to invalidate
the physical conclusion that, while there was an excess of carbonic acid
in the air, the Flora would tend to be Cryptogamic and Gymnospermic, and
that there would be a scarcity of monocotyledons and dicotyledonous
angiosperms in the coal; nothing to disprove the fact that the animals
were slow-breathing and cold-blooded; and that it was not until after the
oxygen of the air had increased and the mean temperature had declined
that birds made their appearance. Though both placental and marsupial
animals may hereafter be found earlier than in the Stonesfield slate;
though wood and herb-eating beetles, grasshoppers, dragon-flies, and
May-flies may be found beneath the lias, and scorpions and cockroaches
beneath the coal, though, also beneath the coal, salamanders and Sauroid
batrachians, of which the archegosaurus is an example, may occur; though
reptiles, as the telerpeton, may be found deeper than the old red
sandstone; yet the connexion between aerial constitution and form of life
will never be shaken. Still will remain the facts that the geographical
distribution of types was anterior to the appearance of existing species,
that organisms first appeared in a liquid medium, primitively marine,
then fluviatile, and at last terrestrial; that Radiates, Molluscs,
Articulates, Vertebrates, were all at first aquatic, and that the
Radiates have ever remained so; that the plane of greatest vital activity
has ever been the sea-level, where the earth and air touch each other;
that the order of individual development is the order of mundane
development. Still will remain the important conclusions that the
mammalian Fauna has diverged more rapidly than the testaceous; that
hot-blooded animals have not had that longevity of <span class="pag">[323]</span> species <a id="which323"></a>which has
been displayed by the cold, just as we observe in the individual the
possibility of muscular contraction by a given galvanic force lasts much
longer in the latter than in the former; that if the hot-blooded tribes
have thus a briefer duration, they enjoy a compensation in the greater
energy of their life&mdash;perhaps this being the cause and that the effect;
that, notwithstanding the countless forms exhibited by species, their
duration is so great that they outlive vast changes in the topographical
configuration of countries&mdash;the Fauna of some countries having been in
existence before those countries themselves; that the plan of individual
development has ever been as it is now, and that sameness of external
influence produces similarity of organization.</p>


<p><span class="side">The doctrine of catastrophes and uniformity. </span>In its early history theoretical geology presented two schools&mdash;one
insisting on a doctrine of catastrophes, one on a doctrine of uniformity.
The former regarded those changes which have manifestly taken place in
the history of our planet as having occurred at epochs abruptly. To this
doctrine the prevailing impression that there had been providential
interventions lent much force. The other school, reposing on the great
principle of the invariability of the laws of Nature, insisted that
affairs had always gone on at the same rate and in the same way as they
do now. Hence it maintained an opposition to the catastrophists, and in
this, it may be said, was actually not true to its own principles. Any
doctrine of uniformity, rightly considered from its most general point of
view, includes an admission of catastrophes. Numerous illustrations of
this truth spontaneously suggest themselves. A tower, the foundations of
which are slowly yielding, may incline more and more for many centuries,
but the day must come in which it will fall at last. In the uniformity of
the disturbance a catastrophe was eventually involved. And thus, in what
has been said respecting geological events, though they are spoken of as
proceeding quietly and with uniformity, it may be understood that sudden
crises are also contemplated. Moreover, those who adopt the doctrine of
uniformity in an absolute sense must pay a due regard to the variations
in intensity of physical acts which <span class="pag">[324]</span> their <a id="own324"></a>own principles imply. The
uniform cooling of a hot body actually means a cooling at first fast, and
then slower and slower; and invariability of chemical change actually
implies more violent and summary modifications at a high temperature than
at one which is low.</p>

<p>But, though it may at first sight have appeared that an admission of the
doctrine of catastrophes is in harmony with a providential government of
the world, and that the emergence of different organic forms in
successive ages is a manifestation of creative intervention, of which it
was admitted that as many as from twelve to twenty, if no more,
successive instances might be recognized, we may well congratulate
ourselves that those important doctrines rest upon a far more substantial
basis. Rightly considered, the facts lead to a very different conclusion.
<span class="side">Successive forms assumed by man.</span>
Physiological investigations have proved that all animals, even man,
during the process of development, pass in succession through a definite
cycle of forms. Starting from a simple cell, form after form, in a
definite order is assumed. In this long line of advance the steps are
ever, in all individuals, the same. But no one would surely suppose that
the changed aspect at any moment presented is due to a providential
interposition.
<span class="side">But they are rigidly determined by law.</span>
On the contrary, it is the inevitable result of what has
been taking place under the law of development, and the sure precursor of
what is about to follow. In the organic world, the successive orders, and
genera, and species are the counterparts of these temporary embryonic
forms of the individual. Indeed, we may say of those successive
geological beings that they are mere embryos of the latest&mdash;embryos that
had gained a power of reproduction. How shall we separate the history of
the individual from the history of the whole? Do not the fortunes and way
of progress of the one follow the fortunes and way of progress of the
other? If, in a transitory manner, these forms are assumed by the
individual, equally in a transitory manner are they assumed by the race.
Nor would it be philosophical to suppose that the management in the one
instance differs from the management in the other. If the one is
demonstrably the issue of a law in action, so <span class="pag">[325]</span> must <a id="the325"></a>the other be too. It
does not matter that the entire cycle is passed through by the individual
in the course of a few months, while in the race it demands ages.
<span class="side">Individual and race development conducted in the same way.</span>
The standard of time that ought to be applied is the respective duration of
life. In man it is much if he attains to threescore years and ten; but
the entire period of human record, embracing several thousand years,
offers not a single instance of the birth, maturity, and death of a
species. They, therefore, who think they find, in the successive species
that have in an orderly manner replaced each other in the life of the
earth, the sure proof of Divine intervention, would do well to determine
at what point the production of such forms by law ceases, and at what
point their production by the immediate act of God begins. Their task
will be as hard to tell where one colour in the rainbow ends and where
the next commences. They will also do well to remember that, in great
mundane events, the scale of time is ample, and that there may be no
essential difference between a course that is run over in a few days and
one that requires for its completion thousands of centuries.</p>


<p><span class="side">Catastrophes disproved by the co-existence of types.</span>The co-existence of different types in the organic series was the
incontrovertible fact by which was demonstrated the gradual passage from
form to form without catastrophes, the argument relied upon gathering
strength from such circumstances as these, that even the fossil shells of
the modern Italian tuffs which are not extinct exhibit a slight want of
correspondence when compared with those now inhabiting the Mediterranean,
some of the old ones being twice and a half as large as the present, and
that there is a numerical passage from strata containing seventy per
cent. of recent shells to those that are altogether recent, or contain
one hundred per cent. This is manifestly indicative of a continually
changing impression bringing on a corresponding modelling. It is the
proof of a slow merging into, or of a measured assumption of, the new
form&mdash;a transition, for the completion of which probably a very long time
is required. That the existing reindeer is found in the same fluviatile
deposits with an extinct hippopotamus seemed certainly to prove that
there was a condition of things <span class="pag">[326]</span> in <a id="which326"></a>which the co-life of those animals
was possible in the same locality, and that, as the physical causes
slowly changed, the one might be eliminated and the other might be left.
That the regulating conditions were altogether physical was obvious from
such facts as that in the bone-caves of Australia all the mammals are
marsupial, and in the pampas of South America they are allied to such
forms as are indigenous, armadilloes, sloths, etc., showing the tokens of
lineage or hereditary transmission. For still more remote times numerous
instances of a similar nature were detected; thus, throughout the whole
Secondary period, the essential characteristic was the wonderful
development of reptile life, while in the Tertiary it was the development
of mammals. But the appearance of mammals had commenced long before that
of reptiles had ceased. Indeed, the latter event is incomplete in our
times; for, though the marine Saurians have been almost entirely removed,
the fluviatile and terrestrial ones maintain themselves, though
diminished both in species and individuals. Now such an overlapping of
reptiles and mammals was altogether irreconcilable with the doctrine of a
crisis or catastrophe, and, in fact, it demonstrated the changing of
organisms in the changing of physical states.</p>


<p><span class="side">Cuvier's doctrine of permanence of species.</span>Cuvier maintained the doctrine of the permanence of animal species from
the facts that the oldest known do not appear to have undergone any
modification, and that every existing one shows a resistance to change.
If his observations are restricted to periods not exceeding human
history, they may perhaps be maintained, but that duration cannot be
looked upon as more than a moment in the limitless progress we are
considering, and it was in this view that Cuvier's doctrine proved to be
incapable of defence.
<span class="side"> Imperfection of evidence in its support.</span>
What does it signify if our domestic animals show
no variations when compared with the corresponding images depicted on the
hieroglyphic monuments of Egypt, or with the descriptions left by ancient
authors? Evidence of that kind is valueless. Does the geologist ask of
the architect his opinion whether there have ever been upliftings and
down-sinkings of the earth? If he did, would not every structure in
Europe be <span class="pag">[327]</span> brought <a id="forward327"></a>forward as an evidence that nothing of the kind had
ever occurred? A leaning tower, or a church with inclining walls in
Italy, might pass for nothing; the Pyramids would testify that Egypt
itself had never undergone any disturbance&mdash;they remain solid on their
bases, undisturbed. But what is the weight of all this when placed in
opposition with the mass of evidence offered by inclined and fractured
strata? And yet such is precisely the proof offered in behalf of the
permanence of animals. The facts with which the zoologist deals, like
those on which the architect depends, are insufficient for the
purpose&mdash;they are wanting in extent of time. There have been movements in
the crust of the earth, though every building in the world may be
perpendicular; there have been transformations of organisms, though for
four thousand years there may have been no perceptible change.</p>


<p><span class="side">Control of organisms by physical conditions.</span>If ever there had been a universal creation of all possible organic forms
or combinations, forthwith vast numbers of them must have disappeared,
every type being eliminated which was not in correspondence with the
external conditions or with the medium in which it was placed. If the
environment or the physical conditions underwent a variation, a
corresponding variation in the forms that could by possibility exist must
ensue, and, from a thorough study of those not eliminated, the physical
conditions might be ascertained; and conversely, from a thorough
knowledge of the physical conditions, the forms that could escape
elimination might be designated. The facts on which Cuvier rested did not
demonstrate what he supposed. His immobility of species was no
consequence of an innate or intrinsic resistance possessed by them, but
merely an illustration that external physical agents had not undergone
any well-marked variation in the time with which he was concerned.</p>


<p><span class="side">Nature of variation of physical conditions.</span>What is here meant by variation in physical forces or condition is not
any intrinsic change in their nature, but the varied manner in which they
may work by interfering with one another, or experiencing declines of
intensity. From the fact that we may read in the fixed stars, through the
progressive motion of light, the history of a million of <span class="pag">[328]</span> past <a id="years328"></a>years, we
may be sure that the forces of nature have undergone no intrinsic change;
that light was propagated at the same rate, was capable of producing the
same optical and chemical effects, and varied in its intensity by
distance as it does now; that heat determined corporeal magnitudes. These
are things that in their nature are absolutely unchangeable. Always, as
now, the freezing of water, and its boiling under a given pressure, must
have been the same; there must have been a thermometric zero of life and
an upward limit, no animal process ever going on below 32° Fahrenheit or
above 212° Fahrenheit.</p>


<p><span class="side">Effect thereof on organisms.</span>But out of this invariability of natural causes variations in their
condition of action arise, and it is these that affect organic forms. Of
such forms, some become at length incapable of maintaining themselves in
the slow progress of change; others acclimatize, or accommodate, or suit
themselves thereto by undergoing modifications, and this was at last
discerned to be the true explanation of extinctions and appearances,
events taking place very slowly in untold periods of time, and rather by
imperceptible degrees than by a sudden catastrophe or crisis.</p>


<p><span class="side">Transmutation of species.</span>The doctrine of the transmutation of species has met with no little
resistance. They who have refused to receive it as one of the truths of
Nature have perhaps not given full weight to physiological evidence. When
they ask, Has any one ever witnessed such an event as the transmutation
of one species into another? has any experimenter ever accomplished it by
artificial means? they do not take a due account of time. In the Fables
it is related that when the flowers were one evening conversing, "Our
gardener," said the rose to the lily, "will live for ever. I have not
seen any change in him. The tulip, who died yesterday, told me that she
had remarked the same thing; she believed that he must be immortal. I am
sure that he never was born."</p>


<p><span class="side">Two modes of action.</span>Two modes have been presented by which we may conceive of the influence
of physical agents upon organic forms. Their long persistent action upon
the individual may give rise to modifications, developing one part,
stunting another; and such variations, being transmitted in an hereditary
way, may become <span class="pag">[329]</span> firmly <a id="fixed329"></a>fixed at last. Thus a given plant may, in the
course of ages, under the influence of unremittingly acting physical
conditions, undergo a permanent change, and a really new plant arise as
soon as, through the repetitions of successive generations, the
modifications have become so thorough, so profound, as to be capable of
transmission with certainty. Perhaps this is what has taken place with
many of our kitchen-garden plants, of which the special varieties may be
propagated by seeds. But there is another mode by which that result may
be reached, even if we decline the doctrine of St. Augustine, who, in his
work "De Civitate Dei," shows how islands may be peopled with animals by
"spontaneous generation." All organic forms originally spring from a
simple cell, the development of which, as indicated by the final form
attained, is manifestly dependent on the physical conditions it has been
exposed to during its course. If those conditions change, that final form
must change correspondingly; and in this manner, since all organic beings
come from the same starting-point&mdash;the same cell, as has been said, which
helplessly submits to whatever impression may be put upon it&mdash;the issue
is the same as though a transformation or transmutation had occurred,
since the descendant is not like its ancestors. Such a manner of
considering these changes is in harmony with our best physiological
knowledge, since it does not limit itself to a small portion of the life
of an individual, but embraces its whole cycle or career. For the more
complete examination of this view I may refer to the second chapter of
the second book of my "Physiology."</p>


<p><span class="side">Problem of the modification of forms.</span>But here has arisen the inquiry, Does the modification of organic forms
depend exclusively on the impressions of external influences, or is it
due to a nisus or force of development residing in the forms themselves?</p>

<p>Whether we consider the entire organic series in its succession, or the
progress of an individual in his development, the orderly course
presented might seem to indicate that the operation is taking place under
a law&mdash;an orderly progression being always suggestive of the operation of
law. But a philosophical caution must, however, be here exercised; for
deceptive appearances <span class="pag">[330]</span> may <a id="lead330"></a>lead us into the error of imputing to such a
law, impressed by the Creator on the developing organism, that which
really belongs to external physical conditions, which, on their part, are
following a law of their own. What is here meant may be illustrated by
the facts that occur on the habitable surface of a planet suffering a
gradual decline of heat.
<span class="side">Three solutions of it.</span>
On such a surface a succession of vegetable
types might make its appearance, and, as these different types emerged or
were eliminated, we might speak of the events as creations and
extinctions, and therefore as the acts of God. Or, in the second place,
we might refer them to an intrinsic force of development imparted to each
germ, which reached in due season its maximum, and then declined and died
out; and, comparing each type with its preceding and succeeding ones, the
interrelation might be suggested to us of the operation of a controlling
law. Or, in the third place, we might look to the external physical
condition&mdash;the decline of heat&mdash;itself taking place at a determinate rate
under a mathematical law, and drawing in its consequences the organic
variations observed.</p>

<p>Now the first of these explanations in reality means the arbitrary and
unchallengeable will of God, who calls into existence, and extinguishes
according to his sovereign pleasure, whatever he pleases; the orderly
progression we notice becoming an evidence that his volitions are not
erratic, but are according to pure reason. The second implies that there
has been impressed upon every germ a law of continuous organic
variation&mdash;it might have been through the arbitrary fiat of God. The
third implies that the successive types owe their appearance and
elimination to a physical influence, which is itself varying under a
strict mathematical necessity; for the law of cooling, which the
circumstances force on our attention, is such a strict mathematical
necessity.</p>


<p><span class="side">Their relative probability. </span>If at this point we balance the probabilities of these three
explanations, we shall perhaps find ourselves biassed toward the last, as
physiologists have been, because of its rigorous scientific aspect, and
should not be surprised to find it supported by an array of facts
depending on the principle that the appearance of <span class="pag">[331]</span> new forms does not
observe a certain inevitable order, or stand in a certain relation to
time. From individual development it might seem as if the advancing
procession of an organism is such that specific forms ever appear in a
certain order one after another, and at certain intervals; but the
fallacy of such a conclusion is apparent when we attend to the orderly
procedure of the physical conditions to which the developing organism is
exposed.
<span class="side">Development is in place, not in time.</span>
The passing through a given form at a given epoch is due to the
relation being to space and its conditions, not to time. And so in the
life of the earth, if development were according to time, we should have
an orderly succession of grades as the earth grew older, and in all
localities, at a given moment, the contemporary organisms would be
similar; but if it were according to space, that rigorous procedure would
not occur; in its stead we should have a broken series, the affiliation
being dependent on the secularly continuous variation of the physical
condition.</p>

<p>Now this was discovered to be the case. For instance, throughout the
northern hemisphere, during the Tertiary period, an extinct placental
Fauna was contemporaneous with an extinct marsupial Fauna in Australia.
If the development was proceeding according to time, by an innate nisus,
and not according to external influences, the types for the same epoch in
the two hemispheres should be the same; if under external influences,
irrespective of time, they should be, as they were found to be,
different.</p>

<p>If true-going clocks, which owe their motion to their own internal
mechanism, were started in all countries of the earth at the same
instant, they would strike their successive hours simultaneously. But
sun-dials, which owe their indications to an exterior cause, would in
different longitudes tell different times, or, when the needful light was
absent, their shadows would altogether fail.</p>

<p>As to the vegetable kingdom, the principles that hold for the animal
again apply. At a very early period, even before the deposit of the coal,
all the distinct forms of vegetable tissue were in existence, and nothing
to prevent, so far as time was concerned, their being united together all
over the world into similar structural <span class="pag">[332]</span> combinations. <a id="And332"></a>And, in truth, as
the botany of the Coal period proves, there was a far more extensive
sameness than we see at present, simply because the distribution of heat
was more uniform and climates were less marked. But from this point the
diversity of form in climate distribution becomes more and more
conspicuous, though we must descend, perhaps, as late as the Wealden
before we discover any flowering plants, except Gymnosperms, as Conifers
and Cycads. All this is what might be expected on the doctrine of
external influence, but not on the doctrine of an innate and interior
developmental force.</p>

<p>If, at this stage, attention is once again turned to the animal kingdom,
we find our opinion confirmed. The diminution of carbonic acid in the
atmosphere, the deposit of coal in the earth, the precipitation of
carbonate of lime in the sea, the disengagement of an increased quantity
of oxygen in the air, and the reduction of atmospheric
pressure&mdash;different effects contemporaneously occurring&mdash;were soon
followed by the consequence which they made possible&mdash;the appearance of
hot-blooded mammals.
<span class="side">Cold and hot-blooded animals.</span>
Perhaps those first arising might, like our
hibernates, lead a sluggish existence, with imperfect respiration; but,
as the media improved and the temperature declined, more vigorous forms
of life emerged, though we have probably to descend to the Tertiary epoch
before we meet with birds, which of all animals have the most energetic
respiration, and possess the highest heat.</p>


<p><span class="side">The organisms of the sea.</span>As with the atmosphere, so with the sea. Variations in its composition
must control the organisms it contains. With its saline constituents its
life must change. Before the sunlight had removed from the atmosphere so
much of its carbonic acid, decomposing it through the agency of plants,
the weight of carbonate of lime held in solution by the highly carbonated
water was far greater than was subsequently possible, and the occurrence
of limestone became a necessary event. With such a disturbance in the
composition of the sea-water, its inhabiting organisms were necessarily
disturbed. And so again, subsequently, when the solar heat began to
preponderate on the surface over the subsiding interior <span class="pag">[333]</span> heat, <a id="the333"></a>the
constitution of the sea-water, as respects its salinity, was altered
through difference of evaporation in different latitudes, an effect
inevitably making a profound impression on marine animal life.</p>


<p><span class="side">Nature of hereditary transmission.</span>Supported by the facts that have been mentioned respecting the later
fossils of Australia and Brazil, and their analogy to forms now existing
in those countries, much stress was laid on the hereditary transmission
of structure, and hence the inference was drawn that such examples are of
a mixed nature, depending in part on external agency, in part on an
interior developmental force. From marsupial animals, marsupials will
issue; from placental ones, those that are placental. But here, perhaps,
an illustration drawn from the inorganic kingdom may not be without
interest and use. Two pieces of carbonate of lime may be rolling among
the pebbles at the bottom of a brook, one perpetually splitting into
rhomboids, the other into arragonitic prisms. The fragments differ from
one another not only thus in their crystalline form, but in their
physical qualities, as density and hardness, and in their optical
qualities also. We might say that the calc-spar crystals gave birth to
calc-spar crystals, and the arragonitic to arragonite; we might admit
that there is an interior propensity, an intrinsic tendency to produce
that result, just as we say that there is a tendency in the marsupial to
engender a marsupial; but if, in our illustration, we look for the cause
of that cause, we find it in a physical impression long antecedently
made, that the carbonate of lime, crystallizing at 212° Fahr., produces
arragonite, and, at a lower temperature, calc-spar; and that the physical
impression thus accomplished, though it may have been thousands of years
ago, was never cast off, but perpetually manifested itself in all the
future history of the two samples. That which we sometimes speak of as
hereditary transmission, and refer to an interior property, peculiarity,
or force, may be nothing more than the manifestation of a physical
impression long antecedently made.</p>

<p>In the last place, the idea of an intrinsic force of development is in
connexion with time and a progression, and only comes into prominence
when we <span class="pag">[334]</span> examine a <a id="limited334"></a>limited portion or number of the things under
consideration. The earth, though very beautiful, is very far from being
perfect.
<span class="side">The broken organic chain.</span>
The plants and animals we see are only the wrecks of a broken
series, an incomplete, and, therefore, unworthy testimonial of the
Almighty power. We should judge very inadequately of some great author if
only here and there a fragmentary paragraph of his work remained; and so,
in the book of organization, we must combine what is left with what we
can recover from past ages and buried strata before we can rise to a
comprehension of the grand argument, and intelligibly grasp the whole
work.</p>


<p><span class="side">Enormous age of the earth.</span>Of that book it is immaterial to what page we turn. It tells us of
effects of such magnitude as imply prodigiously long periods of time for
their accomplishment. Its moments look to us as if they were eternities.
What shall we say when we read in it that there are fossiliferous rocks
which have been slowly raised ten thousand feet above the level of the
sea so lately as since the commencement of the Tertiary times; that the
Purbeck beds of the upper oolite are in themselves the memorials of an
enormous lapse of time; that, since a forest in a thousand years can
scarce produce more than two or three feet of vegetable soil, each
dirt-bed is the work of hundreds of centuries. What shall we say when it
tells us that the delta of the Mississippi could only be formed in many
tens of thousands of years, and yet that is only as yesterday when
compared with the date of the inland terraces; that the recession of the
Falls of Niagara from Queenstown to the present site consumed thirty
thousand years; that if the depression of the carboniferous strata of
Nova Scotia took place at the rate of four feet in a century, there were
demanded 375,000 years for its completion&mdash;such a movement in the upward
direction would have raised Mont Blanc; that it would take as great a
river as the Mississippi two millions of years to convey into the Gulf of
Mexico as much sediment as is found in those strata. Such statements may
appear to us, who with difficulty shake off the absurdities of the
patristic chronology, wild and impossible to be maintained, and yet they
are the conclusions that the most learned and <span class="pag">[335]</span> profound <a id="geologists335"></a>geologists draw
from their reading of the Book of Nature.</p>


<p><span class="side">Summary as respects the world in time.</span>Thus, as respects the age of the earth and her relations in time, we
approach the doctrine of Orientals, who long ago ascertained that the
scales of time and of space correspond to each other. More fortunate than
we, they had but one point of resistance to encounter, but that
resistance they met with dissimulation, and not in an open way. They
attempted to conceal the tendency of their doctrine by allying or
affiliating it with detected errors. According to their national
superstition, the earth is supported on the back of an elephant, and this
on a succession of animals, the last of which is a tortoise. It is not to
be supposed that the Brahmans, who wrote commentaries on the Surya
Siddhanta, should for a moment have accepted these preposterous
delusions&mdash;that was impossible for such great geometers; yet led,
perhaps, by a wish to do nothing that might disturb public feeling, they
engaged in the hopeless task of showing that their profound philosophical
discoveries were not inconsistent with the ancient traditions; that a
globular and revolving earth might be sustained on a descending
succession of supporting beasts. But they had the signal advantage over
us that those popular traditions conceded to them that limitless time for
which we have had to struggle.</p>


<p><span class="side">The life of the universe.</span>The progression of life on the surface of our planet is under the
guidance of pre-ordained and resistless law&mdash;it is affiliated with
material and correspondingly changing conditions. It suggests that the
succession of organic forms which, in a due series, the earth's surface
in the long lapse of time has presented, is the counterpart of a like
progress which other planets in the solar system exhibit in myriads of
years, and leads us to the conception of the rise, development, and
extinction of a multiplicity of such living forms in other systems&mdash;a
march of life through the universe, and its passing away.</p>


<p><span class="side">Multiplicity of worlds implies succession of worlds.</span>Magnitudes and times, therefore, go parallel with one another. With the
abandonment of the geocentric theory, and of the doctrine of the human
destiny of the universe, have vanished the unworthy hypotheses of the
recent date <span class="pag">[336]</span>  <a id="of336"></a>of creation and the approaching end of all things. In their
stead are substituted more noble ideas. The multiplicity of worlds in
infinite space leads to the conception of a succession of worlds in
infinite time. This existing universe, with all its splendours, had a
beginning, and will have an end; it had its predecessors, and will have
its successors; but its march through all its transformations is under
the control of laws as unchangeable as destiny. As a cloud, which is
composed of myriads of separate and isolated spherules of water, so
minute as to be individually invisible, on a summer's afternoon changes
its aspect and form, disappearing from the sky, and being replaced in
succeeding hours by other clouds of a different aspect and shape, so the
universe, which is a cloud of suns and worlds, changes in the immensity
of time its form and fashion, and that which is contemporary with us is
only an example of countless combinations of a like kind, which in
ancient times have one after another vanished away. In periods yet to
come the endless succession of metamorphoses will still go on, a series
of universes to which there is no end.</p>

<p><span class="side">The apparent position of man on the heliocentric theory.</span> <span class="pag">[337]</span> When the ancient doctrine of the plurality of worlds was restored by
Bruno, Galileo, and other modern astronomers, the resistance it
encountered was mainly owing to its anticipated bearing on the nature and
relations of man. It was said, if round our sun, as a centre, there
revolve so many planetary bodies, experiencing the changes of summer and
winter, day and night&mdash;bodies illuminated by satellites, and perhaps
enjoying twilight and other benefits such as have been conferred on the
earth&mdash;shall we not consider them the abodes of accountable, perhaps of
sinful, beings like ourselves? Nay, more; if each of the innumerable
fixed stars is, as our sun, a central focus of light, <span class="pag">[338]</span>  attended <a id="by338"></a>by dark
and revolving globes, is it not necessary to admit that they also have
their inhabitants? But among so many families of intelligent beings, how
is it that we, the denizens of an insignificant speck, have alone been
found worthy of God's regard?</p>

<p>It was this reasoning that sustained the geocentric theory, and made the
earth the centre of the universe, the most noble of created things; the
sun, the moon, the stars, being only ministers for the service of man.</p>


<p><span class="side">The fallacy of objections to that theory.</span>But, like many other objections urged in that memorable conflict, this
was founded on a misconception, or, rather, on imperfect knowledge. There
may be an infinity of worlds placed under the mechanical relations
alluded to, but there may not be one among them that can be the abode of
life. The physical conditions under which organization is possible are so
numerous and so strictly limited that the chances are millions to one
against their conjoint occurrence.</p>


<p><span class="side">Evidence furnished by Geology.</span>In a religious point of view, we are greatly indebted to Geology for the
light it has cast on this objection. It has taught us that during
inconceivable lapses of time our earth itself contained no living thing.
These were those preorganic ages to which reference was made in the last
chapter. Then by slow degrees, as a possibility for existence occurred,
there gradually emerged one type after another. It is but as yesterday
that the life of man could be maintained.</p>


<p><span class="side">The transitory nature of living forms.</span>Only in the presence of special physical conditions can an animal exist.
Even then it is essentially ephemeral. The life of it, as a whole,
depends on the death of its integrant parts. In a waterfall, which
maintains its place and appearance unchanged for many years, the
constituent portions that have been precipitated headlong glide finally
and for ever away. For the transitory matter to exhibit a permanent form,
it is necessary that there should be a perpetual supply and also a
perpetual removal. So long as the jutting ledge over which the waters
rush, and the broken gulf below that receives them, remain unchanged, the
cataract presents the same appearance. But variations in them mould it
into a new shape; its colour changes with a clear or <span class="pag">[339]</span>  cloudy <a id="sky339"></a>sky; the
rainbow seen in its spray disappears when the beams of the sun are
withdrawn.</p>

<p>So in that collection of substance which constitutes an animal; whatever
may be its position, high or low, in the realm of life, there is a
perpetual introduction of new material and a perpetual departure of the
old. It is a form, rather than an individual, that we see. Its permanence
altogether depends on the permanence of the external conditions. If they
change, it also changes, and a new form is the result.</p>


<p><span class="side">Characteristics of animal life.</span>An animal is therefore a form through which material substance is visibly
passing and suffering transmutation into new products. In that act of
transmutation force is disengaged. That which we call its life is the
display of the manner in which the force thus disengaged is expended.</p>


<p><span class="side">Matter and force.</span>A scientific examination of animal life must include two primary facts.
It must consider whence and in what manner the stream of material
substance has been derived, in what manner and whither it passes away.
And, since force can not be created from nothing, and is in its very
nature indestructible, it must determine from what source that which is
displayed by animals has been obtained, in what manner it is employed,
and what disposal is made of it eventually.</p>


<p><span class="side">Force is derived from the sun.</span>The force thus expended is originally derived from the sun. Plants are
the intermedium for its conveyance. The inorganic material of a saline
nature entering into their constitution is obtained from the soil in
which they grow, as is also, for the most part, the water they require;
but their organic substance is derived from the surrounding atmosphere,
and hence it is strictly true that they are condensations from the air.</p>


<p><span class="side">Mode in which plants obtain material substance.</span>These statements may be sufficiently illustrated, and the relation
between plants and animals shown, by tracing the course of any one of the
ingredients entering into the vegetable composition, and derived, as has
been said, from the air. For this purpose, if we select their chief solid
element, carbon, the remarks applicable to the course it follows will
hold good for other accompanying elements. It is scarcely <span class="pag">[340]</span>  necessary <a id="to340"></a>to
embarrass the brief exposition of vegetable life now to be given by any
historical details, since these will come with more propriety
subsequently. It is sufficient to mention that the chemical explanations
of vegetable physiology rest essentially on the discovery of oxygen gas
by Priestley, of the constitution of carbonic acid by Lavoisier, and of
water by Cavendish and Watt.</p>


<p><span class="side">Action of a plant on the air.</span>While the sun is shining, the green parts of plants, especially the
leaves, decompose carbonic acid, one of the ingredients of the
atmospheric air. This substance is composed of two elements, carbon and
oxygen; the former is appropriated by the plant, and enters into the
composition of elaborated or descending sap, from which forthwith organic
products, such as starch, sugar, wood fibre, acids, and bases are made.
The other element, the oxygen, is for the most part refused by the plant,
and returns to the air. As the process of decomposition goes on, new
portions of carbonic acid are presented through mechanical movements, the
trembling of the leaf, breezes, and currents rising from the foliage
warmed by the solar beams giving place to other cool currents that set in
below.</p>

<p>The action of a plant upon the air is therefore the separation of
combustible material from that medium. Carbon is thus obtained from
carbonic acid; from water, hydrogen. Plant life is chemically an
operation of reduction, for in like manner ammonia is decomposed into its
constituents, which are nitrogen and hydrogen; and sulphuric and
phosphoric acids, which like ammonia, may have been brought into the
plant through its roots in the form of salt bodies, are made to yield up
the oxygen with which they had been combined, and their sulphur and
phosphorus, combustible elements, are appropriated.</p>


<p><span class="side">Composition and resolution of matter and force.</span>Every plant, from the humblest moss to the oak of a thousand years, is
thus formed by the sun from material obtained from the air&mdash;combustible
material once united with oxygen, but now separated from that body. It is
of especial importance to remark that in this act of decomposition,
force, under the form of light, has disappeared, and become incorporated
with the combustible, the organizing <span class="pag">[341]</span>  material. <a id="This341"></a>This force is surrendered
again, or reappears whenever the converse operation, combination with
oxygen, occurs.</p>

<p>Vegetable products thus constitute a magazine in which force is stored up
and preserved for any assignable time. Hence they are adapted for animal
food and for the procuring of warmth. The heat evolved in the combustion
of coal in domestic economy was originally light from the sun
appropriated by plants in the Secondary geological times, and locked up
for untold ages. The sun is also the source from which was derived the
light obtained in all our artificial operations of burning gas, oil, fat,
wax, for the purposes of illumination.</p>


<p><span class="side">Correlation of physical forces.</span>My own experiments have proved that it is the light of the sun, in
contradistinction to the heat, which occasions the decomposition of
carbonic acid, furnishing carbon to plants and oxygen to the atmosphere.
But such is the relation of the so-called imponderable principles of
chemistry to each other, and their mutual convertibility, that that which
has disappeared in performing its function as light may reappear as heat
or electricity, or in the production of some mechanical effect.</p>


<p><span class="side">The nature of food.</span>Food is used by all animals for the sake of the force it thus contains,
the remark applying to the carnivora as well as the herbivora. In both
cases the source of supply is the vegetable kingdom, indirectly or
directly. The plant is thus indispensable to the animal. It is the
collector and preserver of that force the expenditure of which
constitutes the special display of animal life.</p>

<p>From this point of view, animals must therefore be considered as
machines, in which force obtained as has been described, is utilized. The
food they take, or the tissue that has been formed from it, is acted upon
by the air they breathe, and undergoes partial or total oxydation, and
now emerges again, in part as heat in part as nerve-force, in some few
instances in part as light or electricity, the force that originally came
from the sun.</p>


<p><span class="side">Cycle through which matter and force pass.</span>There is, therefore, a cycle or revolution through which material
particles suitable for organization incessantly run. At one moment they
exist as inorganic combinations in the air or the soil, <span class="pag">[342]</span>  then as portions
of plants, then as portions of animals, then they return to the air or
soil again to renew their cycle of movement. The metamorphoses feigned by
the poets of antiquity have hence a foundation in fact, and the vegetable
and animal, the organic and inorganic worlds are indissolubly bound
together. Plants are reducing, animals oxydizing, machines. Plants form,
animals destroy.</p>

<p>Thus, by the light of the sun, the carbonic acid of the atmosphere is
decomposed&mdash;its oxygen is set free, its carbon furnished to plants. The
products obtained serve for the food of animals, and in their systems the
carbon is re-oxydized by the air they respire, and, resuming the
condition of carbonic acid, is thrown back into the atmosphere in the
breath, ready to be decomposed by the sunlight once more, and run through
the same cycle of changes again. The growth of a plant and the
respiration of an animal are dependent on each other.</p>


<p><span class="side">The duration of matter and imperishability of force.</span>Material particles are thus the vehicles of force. They undergo no
destruction. Chemically speaking, they are eternal. And so, likewise,
force never deteriorates or becomes lessened. It may assume new phases,
but it is always intrinsically unimpaired. The only changes it can
exhibit are those of aspect and of distribution; of aspect, as
electricity, affinity, light, heat; of distribution, as when the diffused
aggregate of many sunbeams is concentrated in one animal form.</p>

<p>It is but little that we know respecting the mutations and distribution
of force in the universe. We cannot tell what becomes of that which has
characterized animal life, though of its perpetuity we may be assured. It
has no more been destroyed than the material particles of which such
animals consist. They have been transmuted into new forms&mdash;it has taken
on a new aspect. The sum total of matter in the world is invariable; so,
likewise, is the sum total of force.</p>


<p><span class="side">Theory of Averroes.</span>These conclusions resemble in many respects those of the philosophy of
Averroes, but they are free from the heresy which led the Lateran
Council, under Leo&nbsp;X., to condemn the doctrines of the great Spanish
Mohammedan. The error of Averroes consisted in <span class="pag">[343]</span>  this, <a id="that343"></a>that he confounded
what is here spoken of under the designation of force with the psychical
principle, and erroneously applied that which is true for animals to the
case of man, who is to be considered as consisting of three essentially
distinct parts&mdash;a material body, upon which operate various physical
forces, guided and controlled by an intelligent soul.</p>

<p>In the following paragraphs the distinction here made is brought into
more striking relief.</p>


<p><span class="side">Anatomical mode of determining position in the animal series.</span>The station of any animal in the organic series may be determined from
the condition of its nervous system. To this observation man himself is
not an exception. Indeed, just views of his position in the world, of the
nature of his intellect and mental operations, can not be obtained except
from the solid support afforded by Anatomy.
<span class="side">The uselessness of the metaphysical sciences.</span>
 The reader has doubtless
remarked that, in the historical sketch of the later progress of Europe
given in this book, I have not referred to metaphysics, or psychology, or
mental philosophy. Cultivated as they have been, it was not possible for
them to yield any other result than they did among the Greeks. A lever is
no mechanical power unless it has a material point of support. It is only
through the physical that the metaphysical can be discovered.</p>


<p><span class="side">Necessity of resorting to Anatomy and Physiology.</span>An exposition of the structure, the physical forces, and the intellectual
operations of man must be founded on anatomy. We can only determine the
methods of action from the study of the mechanism, and the right
interpretation of that mechanism can only be ascertained from the
construction of its parts, from observations of the manner in which they
are developed, from comparisons with similar structures in other animals,
not rejecting even the lowest, and from an investigation of their habits
and peculiarities. Believing that, in the present state of science,
doctrines in psychology, unless they are sustained by evidence derived
from anatomy and physiology, are not to be relied on, I have not thought
it necessary to devote much space to their introduction. They have not
taken a part in the recent advances of humanity. They belong to an
<span class="pag">[344]</span>  earlier <a id="social344"></a>social period, and are an anachronism in ours. I have referred
to these points heretofore in my work on Physiology, and perhaps shall be
excused the following extract:</p>

<p>"The study of this portion of the mechanism of man brings us therefore in
contact with metaphysical science, and some of its fundamental dogmas we
have to consider. Nearly all philosophers who have cultivated in recent
times that branch of knowledge, have viewed with apprehension the rapid
advances of physiology, foreseeing that it would attempt the final
solution of problems which have exercised the ingenuity of the last
twenty centuries.
<span class="side">Solution of psychological questions.</span>
In this they are not mistaken. Certainly it is
desirable that some new method should be introduced, which may give point
and precision to whatever metaphysical truths exist, and enable us to
distinguish, separate, and dismiss what are only vain and empty
speculations.</p>


<p><span class="side">Uncertainty of metaphysics.</span>"So far from philosophy being a forbidden domain to the physiologist, it
may be asserted that the time has now come when no one is entitled to
express an opinion in philosophy unless he has first studied physiology.
It has hitherto been to the detriment of truth that these processes of
positive investigation have been repudiated. If from the construction of
the human brain we may demonstrate the existence of a soul, is not that a
gain? for there are many who are open to arguments of this class on whom
speculative reasoning or a mere dictum falls without any weight. Why
should we cast aside the solid facts presented to us by material objects?
In his communications throughout the universe with us, God ever
materializes. He equally speaks to us through the thousand graceful
organic forms scattered in profusion over the surface of the earth, and
through the motions and appearances presented by the celestial orbs. Our
noblest and clearest conceptions of his attributes have been obtained
from these material things. I am persuaded that the only possible route
to truth in mental philosophy is through a study of the nervous
mechanism. The experience of 2500 years, and the writings of the great
metaphysicians attest, with a melancholy emphasis, the vanity of all
other means.</p>

<p> <span class="pag">[345]</span>  "Whatever may be said by speculative philosophers to the contrary, the
advancement of metaphysics is through the study of physiology. What sort
of a science would optics have been among men who had purposely put out
their own eyes? What would have been the progress of astronomy among
those who disdained to look at the heavens? Yet such is the preposterous
course followed by the so-called philosophers. They have given us
imposing doctrines of the nature and attributes of the mind in absolute
ignorance of its material substratum.
<span class="side">Necessity of the interpretation of structure.</span>
Of the great authors who have thus
succeeded one another in ephemeral celebrity, how many made themselves
acquainted with the structure of the human brain? Doubtless some had been
so unfortunate as never to see one! Yet that wonderful organ was the
basis of all their speculations. In voluntarily isolating themselves from
every solid fact which might serve to be a landmark to them, they may be
truly said to have sailed upon a shoreless sea from which the fog never
lifts. The only fact they teach us with certainty is, that they know
nothing with certainty. It is the inherent difficulty of their method
that it must lead to unsubstantial results. What is not founded on a
material substratum is necessarily a castle in the air."</p>


<p><span class="side">Intellectual relations of man depend on his nervous system.</span>
Considering thus that scientific views of the nature of man can only be
obtained from an examination of his nervous system, and that the right
interpretation of the manner of action of that system depends on the
guiding light of comparative anatomy and physiology, I shall, in the
following exposition, present the progress of discovery on those
principles.</p>


<p><span class="side">The rudimentary nervous system is automatic.</span>In those low tribes of life which show the first indications of a nervous
system, its operation is purely mechanical. An external impression, as a
touch, made upon animals of that kind, is instantly answered to by a
motion which they execute, and this without any manifestation of will or
consciousness. The phenomenon is exactly of the same kind as in a machine
of which, if a given lever is touched, a motion is instantly produced.</p>


<p> <span class="side">Two elementary forms of nerve structure.</span><span class="pag">[346]</span>  <a id="In346"></a>In any nervous system there are two portions anatomically distinct. They
are, 1st, the fibrous; 2d, the vesicular. It may be desirable to describe
briefly the construction and functions of each of these portions. Their
conjoint action will then be intelligible.</p>



<p><span class="side">Structure of a nerve fibre.</span>1st. A nerve fibre consists essentially of a delicate thread&mdash;the axis
filament, as it is called&mdash;enveloped in an oil-like substance, which
coagulates or congeals after death. This, in its turn, is inclosed in a
thin investing sheath or membranous tube. Many such fibres bound together
constitute a nerve.</p>


<p><span class="side">Function of a nerve fibre is conduction.</span>The function of such a nerve fibre is indisputably altogether of a
physical kind, being the conveyance of influences from part to part. The
axis filament is the line along which the translation occurs, the
investing material being for the purpose of confining or insulating it,
so as to prevent any lateral escape. Such a construction is the exact
counterpart of many electrical contrivances, in which a metallic wire is
coated over with sealing-wax or wrapped round with silk, the current
being thus compelled to move in the wire without any lateral escape. Of
such fibres, some convey their influences to the interior, and hence are
called centripetal; some convey them to the exterior, and hence are
called centrifugal. No anatomical difference in the structure of the two
has, however, thus far been discovered. As in a conducting wire the
electrical current moves in a progressive manner with a definite
velocity, so in a nerve filament the influence advances progressively at
a rate said to be dependent on the temperature of the animal examined. It
seems in the cold-blooded to be much slower than in the hot. It has been
estimated in the frog at eighty-five feet per second; in man at two
hundred feet&mdash;an estimate probably too low.</p>

<p>The fibres thus described are of the kind designated by physiologists as
the cerebro-spinal; there are others, passing under the name of the
sympathetic, characterized by not possessing the investing medullary
substance. In colour they are yellowish-gray; but it is not necessary
here to consider them further.</p>


<p><span class="side">Structure of a nerve vesicle.</span> <span class="pag">[347]</span>  2nd. <a id="The347"></a>The other portion of the nervous structure is the vesicular. As its
name imports, it consists of vesicles filled with a gray granular
material. Each vesicle has a thickened spot or nucleus upon it, and
appears to be connected with one or more fibres. If the connexion is only
with one, the vesicle is called unipolar; if with two, bipolar; if with
many, multipolar or stellate. Every vesicle is abundantly supplied with
blood.</p>


<p><span class="side">Function of a nerve vesicle.</span>As might be inferred from its structure, the vesicle differs altogether
from the fibre in function. I may refer to my "Physiology" for the
reasons which have led to the inference that these are contrivances for
the purposes of permitting influences that have been translated along or
confined within the fibre to escape and diffuse themselves in the gray
granular material. They also permit influences that are coming through
many different channels into a multipolar vesicle to communicate or mix
with one another, and combine to produce new results. Moreover, in them
influences may be long preserved, and thus they become magazines of
force. Combined together, they constitute ganglia or nerve centres, on
which, if impressions be made, they do not necessarily forthwith die out,
but may remain gradually declining away for a long time. Thus is
introduced into the nervous mechanism the element of time, and this
important function of the nerve vesicle lies at the basis of memory.</p>

<p>It has been said that the vesicular portion of the nerve mechanism is
copiously supplied with blood. Indeed, the condition indispensably
necessary for its functional activity is waste by oxydation. Arterial
vessels are abundantly furnished to insure the necessary supply of
aerated blood, and veins to carry away the wasted products of decay.
Also, through the former, the necessary materials for repair and
renovation are brought.
<span class="side">Physiological condition of nerve action is nerve waste.</span>
There is a definite waste of nervous substance in
the production of a definite mechanical or intellectual result&mdash;a
material connexion and condition that must never be overlooked. Hence it
is plain that unless the repair and the waste are synchronously equal to
one another, periodicities in the action of the nervous system will
arise, this being the fundamental <span class="pag">[348]</span>  condition <a id="connected348"></a>connected with the physical
theories of sleep and fatigue.</p>

<p>The statements here made rest upon two distinct forms of evidence. In
part they are derived from an interpretation of anatomical structure, and
in part from direct experiment, chiefly by the aid of feeble electrical
currents. The registering or preserving action displayed by a ganglion
may be considered as an effect, resembling that of the construction known
as Ritter's secondary piles.</p>

<p>It will not suit my purpose to offer more than the simplest illustration
of the application of the foregoing facts. When an impression, either by
pressure or in any other way, is made on the exterior termination of a
centripetal fibre, the influence is conveyed with a velocity such as has
been mentioned into the vesicle to which that fibre is attached, and
thence, going forth along the centrifugal fibre, may give rise to motion
through contraction of the muscle to which that fibre is distributed.
<span class="side">Reflex action of the nervous system.</span>
 An impression has thus produced a motion, and to the operation the
designation of reflexion is commonly given. This reflexion takes place
without consciousness. The three parts&mdash;the centripetal fibre, the
vesicle, and the centrifugal fibre&mdash;conjointly constitute a simple
nervous arc.</p>


<p><span class="side">Gradual complexity of the nervous system.</span>A repetition of these arcs, each precisely like all the others,
constitutes the first step toward a complex nervous system. Their manner
of arrangement is necessarily subordinated to the general plan of
construction of the animals in which they occur. Thus, in the Radiates it
is circular; in the Articulates, linear, or upon an axis. But, as the
conditions of life require consentaneousness of motion in the different
parts, these nerve arcs are not left isolated or without connexion with
each other. As it is anatomically termed, they are commissured, nerve
fibres passing from each to its neighbours, and each is thus brought into
sympathy or connexion with all the others.</p>


<p><span class="side">First appearance of special ganglia.</span>The next advance is a very important one, for it indicates the general
plan on which the nervous system is to be developed: it is the dedication
of special nerve arcs to special duties. Thus, <span class="pag">[349]</span>  in <a id="the349"></a>the higher articulates
and molluscs, there are such combinations expressly for the purpose of
respiration and deglutition. Their action is altogether of the reflex
kind; it takes place without consciousness. These ganglia are commissured
for the sake of sympathetic action, and frequently several of them are
coalesced for the sake of package.</p>

<p>This principle of dedication to special uses is carried out in the
introduction of ganglia intended to be affected by light, or sounds, or
odours. The impressions of those agencies are carried to the ganglion by
its centripetal fibres. Such ganglia of special action are most commonly
coalesced together, forming nervous masses of conspicuous size; they are
always commissured with those for ordinary motions, the action being
reflex, as in the preceding case, though of a higher order, since it is
attended with consciousness.</p>


<p><span class="side">They are automatic mechanisms.</span>Such being the elementary construction of a nervous system, it is plain
that animal tribes in which it exists in no higher degree of complexity
must be merely automata. In this remark many insects must be included,
for the instinct they display is altogether of a mechanical kind, and, so
far as they are concerned, without design. Their actions are uniformly
alike; what one does under given circumstances, under the same
circumstances another will certainly do. They are incapable of education,
they learn nothing by experience, and the acts they are engaged in they
accomplish as well at the first trial as ever after.</p>

<p>Of parts like those described, and of others of a higher order, as will
be presently seen, the most complex nervous system, even that of man, is
composed.
<span class="side">Evidence to be used in these investigations.</span>
It might, perhaps, be expected that for the determination of
the duty of each part of such complex system the physiologist must
necessarily resort to experiment, observing what functions have been
injured or destroyed when given portions have been removed by his knife.
At the best, however, evidence of that kind must be very unsatisfactory
on account of the shock the entire system receives in vivisections, and
accordingly, artificial evidence can, for the most part, be used only in
a corroborative way. But, as <span class="pag">[350]</span>  Cuvier <a id="observed350"></a>observed, the hand of Nature has
prepared for us these very experiments without that drawback. The animal
series, as we advance upward from its lowest members, proves to us what
is the effect of the addition of new parts in succession to a nervous
system, as also does any individual thereof in its successive periods of
development. It is one of the most important discoveries of modern
physiology that, as respects their nervous system, we can safely transfer
our reasonings and conclusions from the case of the lowest to that of the
highest animal tribes.</p>

<p>The articulata present structures and a mode of action illustrating in a
striking manner the nervous system of man. Lengthwise upon their ventral
region is laid a double cord, with ganglia, like a string of beads;
sometimes the cords are a little distance apart, but more generally they
are coalesced, each pair of ganglia being fused into one.
<span class="side">First introduction of governing ganglia.</span>
 To every segment of the body a pair is supplied, each pair controlling its own
segment, and acting toward it automatically, each also acting like any of
the others. But in the region of the head there is a special pair, the
cephalic ganglia, receiving fibres from the eyes and other organs of
sense. From them proceed filaments to the ventral cord, establishing
communications with every segment. So every part has two connexions, one
with its own ventral ganglia, and one with the cephalic.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to determine experimentally the functions of the
ventral ganglia and those of the cephalic. If a centipede be decapitated,
its body is still capable of moving, the motion being evidently of a
reflex kind, originating in the pressure of the legs against the surface
on which they rest.
<span class="side">But thus far actions are only instinctive.</span>
The ventral cord, with its ganglia, is hence purely
an automatic mechanism. But if, in making the decapitation, we leave a
portion of the body in connexion with the head, we recognize very plainly
that the cephalic ganglia are exercising a governing power. In the part
from which they have been cut off the movement is forward, regardless of
any obstacle; in that to which they are attached there are modifications
in the motions, depending on sight or other special senses; obstacles are
avoided, and a <span class="pag">[351]</span> variety <a id="of351"></a>of directions pursued. Yet still the actions are
not intelligent, only instinctive. The general conclusion therefore is,
that the cephalic ganglia are of a higher order than the ventral, the
latter being simply mechanical, the former instinctive; but thus far
there is no trace of intelligence.</p>


<p><span class="side">Nervous anatomy of vertebrates, as man. </span>In man these typical parts are all present, and discharge the functions
specified. His spinal cord answers to the ventral cord of the
articulates. It has its lateral communications in the same way, and each
segmental portion presents the same reflex action. Toward its upper part
it dilates to form the medulla oblongata, sending forth nerves for
respiration and deglutition.
<span class="side">Their automatic apparatus. </span>
Of these the action is still reflex, as is
proved by the involuntary movements of respiration and deglutition. A
portion of food being placed in the pharynx, contraction instantly
occurs, the will having no kind of control over the act of swallowing.
<span class="side">Their instinctive apparatus.</span>
Above or in front of this enlargement is a series of ganglia, to which
converge the nerves of special sense&mdash;of hearing, sight, smell; these
are, therefore, the equivalents of the cephalic ganglia of insects, their
function being also the same. In the lowest vertebrates, as in the
amphioxus, the nervous system consists of nothing more. It may therefore
be said to have only two parts&mdash;the cord and the sensory ganglia, and to
have two functions&mdash;the automatic, attributable to the former, and the
instinctive, attributable to the latter.</p>

<p>But as we advance from the low vertebrates upward in the animal scale, we
begin to detect new organs; on the medulla oblongata a cerebellum, and on
the sensory ganglia a cerebrum.
<span class="side">Their intellectual apparatus.</span>
From this moment the animal displays
reasoning powers, its intelligence becoming more strikingly marked as the
development of the new organs is greater.</p>


<p><span class="side">Functions of the brain.</span>It remains to determine with exactness the function of one of these new
parts, the cerebrum; the other portion, the cerebellum, being of minor
interest, and connected, probably, with the locomotive apparatus. For the
same reason it is unnecessary to speak of the sympathetic nerve, since it
belongs to the apparatus of <span class="pag">[352]</span> <a id="organic352"></a>organic life. Confining our attention,
therefore, to the true brain, or cerebrum, we soon recognize that the
intelligence of an animal is, in a general manner, proportional to the
relative size of this organ as compared with the sensory ganglia. We are
also struck with the fact that the cerebrum does not send forth to other
portions any independent fibres of its own, nor does it receive any from
them, its only means of communication being through the parts that have
been described&mdash;that is to say, through the sensory and automatic
apparatus.
<span class="side">Its relations to the instinctive and automatic portions.</span>
 The cerebrum is therefore a mechanism of a higher order, and
its relationship with the thalami optici and corpora striata indicate the
conditions of its functions. It can only receive impressions which have
come through them, and only act upon the body through their intermedium.
<span class="side">Its secondary and tertiary lobes.</span>
Moreover, as we ascend the animal scale, we find that these cerebral
parts not only increase in size, but likewise, in their turn, give rise
to offshoots; secondary lobes emerging posteriorly on the primary ones,
and, in due season, tertiary lobes posteriorly on the secondary. To
these, in human anatomy, the designations of anterior, middle, and
posterior lobes have been respectively given. In proportion, as this
development has proceeded, the intellectual qualities have become more
varied and more profound.</p>


<p><span class="side">Action of the spinal cord alone.</span>The relation of the cerebrum to the cranio-spinal axis is manifested by
the circumstance that the latter can act without the former. In sleep the
cerebrum is, as it were, torpid, but respiration, deglutition, and other
reflex actions go on. If we touch the palm of a sleeping infant our
finger is instantly grasped.
<span class="side">Conjoint action of the brain and cord.</span>
But, though the axis can work without the
cerebrum, the cerebrum can not work without the axis. Illustrations of
these truths may be experimentally obtained. An animal from which the
cerebrum has been purposely removed may be observed to perform actions
automatic and instinctive, but never intelligent; and that there is no
difference between animals and man in this respect is demonstrated by the
numerous instances recorded in the works of medicine and surgery of
injuries by accident or disease to the <span class="pag">[353]</span> human <a id="nervous353"></a>nervous system, the effects
corresponding to those artificially produced in experiments on animals.
This important observation, moreover, shows that we may with correctness
use the observations made on animals in our investigations of the human
system.</p>


<p><span class="side">Three distinct parts of the nervous system of man. </span>In the nervous system of man our attention is therefore especially
demanded by three essentially distinct parts&mdash;the spinal cord, the
sensory ganglia, and the cerebrum.
<span class="side">They are the automatic, the instinctive, the intellectual. </span>
Of the first, the spinal cord, the
action is automatic; by its aid we can walk, from place to place, without
bestowing a thought on our movements; by it we swallow involuntarily; by
it we respire unconsciously. The second portion, the sensory ganglia, is,
as we have seen, the counterpart of the cephalic ganglia of
invertebrates; it is the place of reception of sensuous impressions and
the seat of consciousness. To these ganglia instinct is to be referred.
Their function is not at all impaired by the cerebrum superposed upon
them. The third portion, the cerebrum, is anatomically distinct. It is
the seat of ideas. It does not directly give rise to motions, being
obliged to employ for that purpose its intermediate automatic associated
apparatus.
<span class="side">Dominating control of the latter.</span>
In this realm of ideas thoughts spring forth suggestively from
one another in a perpetual train or flux, and yet the highest branch of
the nervous mechanism still retains traces of the modes of operation of
the parts from which it was developed. Its action is still often reflex.
Reason is not always able to control our emotions, as when we laugh or
weep in spite of ourselves, under the impression of some external
incident. Nay, more; the inciting cause may be, as we very well know,
nothing material&mdash;nothing but a recollection, an idea&mdash;and yet it is
enough. But these phenomena are perhaps restricted to the first or
anterior lobes of the brain, and, accordingly, we remark them most
distinctly in children and in animals. As the second and third lobes
begin to exercise their power, such effects are brought under control.</p>


<p><span class="side">Progressive nervous development in the animal series.</span>There is, therefore, a regular progression, a definite improvement in the
nervous system of the animal series, the plan never varying, but being
persistently carried <span class="pag">[354]</span> out, and thus offering a powerful argument for
relationship among all those successively improving forms, an observation
which becomes of the utmost interest to us in its application to the
vertebrates. In the amphioxus, as has been said, the cranio-spinal axis
alone exists; the Cyclostome fishes are but a step higher. In fishes the
true cerebrum appears at first in an insignificant manner, a condition
repeated in the early embryonic state both of birds and mammals. An
improvement is made in reptiles, whose cerebral hemispheres are larger
than their optic lobes. As we advance to birds, a further increase
occurs; the hemispheres are now of nearly sufficient dimensions to cover
over those ganglia. In the lower mammals there is another step, yet not a
very great one. But from the anterior lobes, which thus far have
constituted the entire brain, there are next to be developed the middle
lobes. In the Rodents the progress is still continued, and in the
Ruminants and Pachyderms the convolutions have become well marked.
<span class="side">It attains its maximum in man.</span>
 In the higher carnivora and quadrumana the posterior or tertiary lobes appear.
The passage from the anthropoid apes to man brings us to the utmost
development thus far attained by the nervous system. The cerebrum has
reached its maximum organization by a continued and unbroken process of
development.</p>


<p><span class="side">The same progressive development occurs in each individual man.</span>This orderly development of the nervous system in the animal series is
recognized again in the gradual development of the individual man. The
primitive trace, as it faintly appears in the germinal membrane, marks
out the place presently to be occupied by the cranio-spinal axis, and,
that point of development gained, man answers to the amphioxus. Not until
the twelfth week of embryonic life does he reach the state permanently
presented by birds; at this time the anterior lobes are only perceptible.
In four or six weeks more the middle lobes are evolved posteriorly on the
anterior, and, finally, in a similar manner, the tertiary or posterior
ones are formed. And thus it appears that, compared with the nervous
system of other animals, that of man proceeds through the same
predetermined <span class="pag">[355]</span> succession <a id="of355"></a>of forms. Theirs suffers an arrest, in some
instances at a lower, in some at a higher point, but his passes onward to
completion.</p>


<p><span class="side">It occurs again in the entire life of the globe.</span>But that is not all. The biography of the earth, the life of the entire
globe, corresponds to this progress of the individual, to this orderly
relation of the animal series. Commencing with the oldest rocks that
furnish animal remains, and advancing to the most recent, we recognize a
continual improvement in construction, indicated by the degree of
advancement of the nervous system. The earliest fishes did not proceed
beyond that condition of the spinal column which is to be considered as
embryonic. The Silurian and Devonian rocks do not present it in an
ossified state. Fishes, up to the Carboniferous epoch, had a heterocercal
tail, just as the embryos of osseous fishes of the present time have up
to a certain period of their life. There was, therefore, an arrest in the
old extinct forms, and an advance to a higher point in the more modern.
The buckler-headed fishes of the Devonian rocks had their respiratory
organs and much of their digestive apparatus in the head, and showed an
approximation to the tadpoles or embryos of the frog. The crocodiles of
the oolite had biconcave vertebræ, like the embryos of the recent ones
which have gained the capability of making an advance to a higher point.
In the geological order, reptiles make their appearance next after
fishes, and this is what we should expect on the principle of an
ascending nervous development. Not until long after come birds, later in
date and higher in nervous advancement, capable not only of instinct, but
also of intelligence. Of mammals, the first that appear are what we
should have expected&mdash;the marsupials; but among the tertiary rocks, very
many other forms are presented, the earlier ones, whether herbivorous or
carnivorous, having a closer correspondence to the archetype than the
existing ones, save in their embryonic states, the analogies occurring in
such minor details as the possession of forty-four teeth.
<span class="side">Absolute necessity of admitting transmutation of forms.</span>
 The biography of the earth is thus, on the great scale, typical of individual life,
even that of man, and the succession of species in the <span class="pag">[356]</span> progress of
numberless ages is the counterpart of the transmutation of an individual
from form to form. As in a dissolving view, new objects emerge from old
ones, and new forms spontaneously appear without the exercise of any
periodical creative act.</p>


<p><span class="side">Life of man from infancy to maturity in accordance with his anatomy.</span>For some days after birth the actions of the human being are merely
reflex. Its cranio-spinal axis alone is in operation, and thus far it is
only an automaton. But soon the impressions of external objects begin to
be registered or preserved in the sensory ganglia, and the evidences of
memory appear. The first token of this is perhaps the display of an
attachment to persons, not through any intelligent recognition of
relationship, but merely because of familiarity. This is followed by the
manifestation of a liking to accustomed places and a dread of strange
ones. At this stage the infant is leading an instinctive life, and has
made no greater advance than many of the lower mammals; but they linger
here, while he proceeds onward. He soon shows high powers of memory, the
exercise of reason in the determinations of judgment, and in the
adaptation of varied means to varied ends.</p>

<p>Such is therefore the process of development of the nervous system of
man; such are the powers which consequently he successively displays. His
reason at last is paramount. No longer are his actions exclusively
prompted by sensations; they are determined much more by ideas that have
resulted from his former experiences. While animals which approach him
most closely in construction require an external stimulus to commence a
train of thought, he can direct his mental operations, and in this
respect is parted from them by a vast interval. The states through which
he has passed are the automatic, the instinctive, the intellectual; each
has its own apparatus, and all at last work harmoniously together.</p>


<p><span class="side">Every person consists of two lateral individuals.</span>But besides this superposition of an instinctive apparatus upon an
automatic one, and an intellectual upon an instinctive, the nervous
system consists of two equal and symmetrical lateral portions, a right
half and a left. Each person may be considered as consisting in reality
of two individuals. <span class="pag">[357]</span> <a id="The357"></a>The right half may be stricken with palsy, the left be unimpaired; one
may lose its sight or hearing, the other may retain them. These lateral
halves lead independent lives. Yet, though independent in this sense,
they are closely connected in another. The brain of the right side rules
over the left half of the body, that of the left side rules over the
right of the body.
<span class="side">Consequences of this doubleness of construction.</span>
On the relationships and antagonisms of the two halves
of the cerebro-spinal system must be founded our explanations of the
otherwise mysterious phenomena of double and alternate life; of the
sentiment of pre-existence; of trains of thought, often double, but never
triple; of the wilful delusions of castle-building, in which one
hemisphere of the brain listens to the romance suggestions of the other,
though both well know that the subject they are entertaining themselves
with is a mere fiction. The strength and precision of mental operations
depend as much upon the complete equivalency of the two lateral halves as
upon their absolute development. It is scarcely to be expected that great
intellectual indications will be given by him, one of whose cerebral
hemispheres is unequal to the other. But for the detailed consideration
of these topics I may refer the reader to my work on Physiology. He will
there find the explanation of the nature of registering ganglia; the
physical theory of memory; the causes of our variable psychical powers at
different times; the description of the ear as the organ of time; the eye
as the organ of space; the touch as that of pressures and temperatures;
the smell and taste as those for the chemical determination of gases and
liquids.</p>


<p><span class="side">Conclusions from the foregoing anatomical facts. </span>From a consideration of the construction, development, and action of the
nervous system of man, we may gain correct views of his relations to
other organic beings, and obtain true psychical and metaphysical
theories. There is not that homogeneousness in his intellectual structure
which writers on those topics so long supposed. It is a triple mechanism.
<span class="side">Man a member of the animal series.</span>
A gentle, a gradual, a definite development reaches its maximum in him
without a breach of continuity. Parts which, because of their completion,
are capable of yielding in him such splendid <span class="pag">[358]</span> results, are seen in a
rudimentary and useless condition in organisms very far down below. On
the clear recognition of this rudimentary, this useless state, very much
depends. It indicates the master-fact of psychology&mdash;the fact that
Averroes overlooked&mdash;that, while man agrees with inferior beings in the
type of his construction, and passes in his development through
transformations analogous to theirs, he differs from them all in this,
that he alone possesses an accountable, an immortal soul. It is true that
there are some which closely approach him in structure, but the existence
of structure by no means implies the exercise of functions. In the
still-born infant, the mechanism for respiration, the lungs, is
completed; but the air may never enter, and the intention for which they
were formed never be carried out.</p>


<p><span class="side">His life and that of the planet alike.</span>Moreover, it appears that the order of development in the life of
individual man and the order of development in the life of the earth are
the same, their common features indicating a common plan. The one is the
movement of a few hours, the other of myriads of ages. This sameness of
manner in their progression points out their dependence on a law
immutable and universal. The successive appearance of the animal series
in the endless course of time has not, therefore, been accidental, but as
predetermined and as certain as the successive forms of the individual.
In the latter we do not find any cause of surprise in the assumption of
states ever increasing in improvement, ever rising higher and higher
toward the perfection destined to be attained. We look upon it as the
course of nature. Why, then, should we consider the extinctions and
creations of the former as offering any thing unaccountable, as connected
with a sudden creative fiat or with an arbitrary sentence of destruction?</p>


<p><span class="side">Progress of humanity is according to law.</span>In this book I have endeavoured to investigate the progress of humanity,
and found that it shows all the phases of individual movement, the
evidence employed being historical, and, therefore, of a nature
altogether different from that on which our conclusions in the collateral
instances rest. It may serve to assure us that the ideas here presented
<span class="pag">[359]</span> are <a id="true359"></a>true when we encounter, at the close of our investigation, this
harmony between the life of the individual, the life of society, and the
life of the earth.</p>

<p>Is it probable that the individual proceeds in his movement of
development under law, that the planet also proceeds in its movements
under law, but that society does not proceed under law?</p>


<p><span class="side">Eternity and universality of that law.</span>Man, thus, is the last term of an innumerable series of organisms, which,
under the domination of law, has, in the lapse of time, been evolving.
Law has controlled the inorganic world, and caused the earth to pass
through various physical conditions, gently and continuously succeeding
one another. The plastic forms of organic beings have been modelled to
suit those changing conditions. The invariability of that law is
indicated by the numberless ages through which it has been maintained,
its universality by its holding good in the life of the meanest
individual.</p>

<p>But it is only a part of sociology that we have considered, and of which
we have investigated the development.
<span class="side">Comparative sociology.</span>
In the most philosophical aspect
the subject includes comparative as well as human sociology. For, though
there may not be society where actions are simply reflex, there is a
possibility of it where they are instinctive, as well as where they are
intellectual. Its essential condition being intercommunication, there are
necessarily modifications depending respectively on touch or upon the
higher and more delicate senses. That is none the less society which,
among insects, depends upon antennal contacts. Human society, founded on
speech, sight, hearing, has its indistinct beginnings, its rudiments,
very low down in the animal scale, as in the bell-like note which some of
the nudibranchiate gasteropods emit, or the solitary midnight tapping
with which the death-watch salutes his mate. Society resting on instinct
is characterised by immobility; it is necessarily unprogressive. Society
resting on intellect is always advancing.</p>

<p>But, for the present, declining this general examination of sociology,
and limiting our attention strictly to that of humanity, we can not fail
to be struck with the fact that in us the direction of evolution is
altogether toward <span class="pag">[360]</span> the intellectual, a conclusion equally impressed upon
us whether our mode of examination be anatomical or historical.
<span class="side">The aim of Nature is not at moral, but intellectual development. </span>
Anatomically we find no provision in the nervous system for the
improvement of the moral, save indirectly through the intellectual, the
whole aim of development being for the sake of intelligence.
Historically, in the same manner, we find that the intellectual has
always led the way in social advancement, the moral having been
subordinate thereto. The former hay been the mainspring of the movement,
the latter passively affected. It is a mistake to make the progress of
society depend on that which is itself controlled by a higher power. In
the earlier and inferior stages of individual life we may govern through
the moral alone. In that way we may guide children, but it is to the
understanding of the adult that we must appeal.
<span class="side">Systems of policy must be in accordance therewith.</span>
A system working only
through the moral must sooner or later come into an antagonism with the
intellectual, and, if it do not contain within itself a means of
adaptation to the changing circumstances, it must in the end be
overthrown. This was the grand error of that Roman system which presided
while European civilization was developing. It assumed as its basis a
uniform, a stationary psychological condition in man. Forgetting that the
powers of the mind grow with the possessions of the mind, it considered
those who lived in past generations as being in no respect mentally
inferior to those who are living now, though our children at sixteen may
have a wider range of knowledge than our ancestors at sixty. That such an
imperfect system could exist for so many ages is a proof of a
contemporary condition of undeveloped intellect, just as we see that the
understanding of a child does not revolt against the moral suasion, often
intrinsically feeble, through which we attempt to influence him. But it
would be as unphilosophical to treat with disdain the ideas that have
served for a guide in the earlier ages of European life, as to look with
contempt on the motives that have guided us in youth. Their feebleness
and incompetency are excused by their suitability to the period of life
to which they are applied.</p>

<p> <span class="pag">[361]</span>But whoever considers these things will see that there is a term beyond
which the application of such methods cannot be extended.
<span class="side">The Age of Reason demands intellectual incentives for the individual.</span>
 The head of a family would act unwisely if he attempted to apply to his son at
twenty-one the methods he had successfully used at ten; such methods
could be only rendered effective by a resort to physical compulsion. A
great change in the intervening years has taken place, and ideas once
intrinsically powerful can exert their influence no more. The moral may
have remained unchanged; it may be precisely as it was&mdash;no better, no
worse; but that which has changed is the understanding. Reasoning and
inducements of an intellectual kind are now needful. An attempt to
persist in an absolute system by constraint would only meet with
remonstrance and derision.</p>


<p><span class="side">And the same holds good for humanity.</span>If it is thus with the individual, so it is likewise with humanity. For
centuries nations may live under forms that meet their requirements,
forms suitable to a feeble state; but it is altogether illusory to
suppose that such an adaptedness can continue for ever. A critical eye
discerns that the mental features of a given generation have become
different from those of its ancestors. New ideas and a new manner of
action are the tokens that a modification has silently taken place.
Though after a short interval the change might not amount to much, in the
course of time there must inevitably be exhibited the spectacle of a
society that had outgrown its forms, its rules of life.</p>

<p>Wherever, then, such a want of harmony becomes perceptible, where the
social system is incompatible with the social state, and is, in effect,
an obsolete anachronism, it is plainly unphilosophical and unwise to
resort to means of compulsion. No matter what the power of governments or
of human authorities may be, it is impossible for them to stop the
intellectual advancement, for it forces its way by an organic law over
which they have no kind of control.</p>

to take effect, this night and stillness would give place to activity and
change. In the morning beams of the day, the tropical waters, expanding,
would follow from east to west the course of the sun, each renewed dawn
renewing the impulse, and adding force to the gentle but resistless
current. At one place the flowing mass would move compactly; at another,
caught by accidentally projecting rocks, it would give off little eddies,
expending their share of its force; or, compressed in narrow passages, it
would rush impetuously along. Upon its surface myriads of momentary
ripples would play, or opposing winds, called into existence by similar
disturbances in the air, would force it into waves, making the shores
resound with their breaking surge. Twice every day, under the conjoint
influences of the sun and moon, as if the inanimate globe itself were
breathing, the tide would rise and fall again upon the bosom of the deep.</p>

<p>The eddy, the ripple, the wave, the current, are accidental forms through
which the originally imparted force is displayed. They are all expending
power. Their life, if such a term can be used, is not the property of
themselves, but of the ocean to which they belong.</p>


<p><span class="side">and on organic nature.</span>Influences which thus metaphorically give life to the sea, in reality
give life to the land. Under their genial operation a wave of verdure
spreads over the earth, and countless myriads of animated things attend
it, each like the eddies and ripples of the sea, expending its share of
the imparted force. The life of these accidental forms, through which
power is being transposed, belongs, not to itself, but to the universe of
which it is a part.</p>


<p><span class="side">Nature of animals.</span>Of the waves upon the ocean there may not be two alike. The winds, the
shores, their mutual <span class="pag">[363]</span> interferences, a <a id="hundred363"></a>hundred extraneous influences,
mould them into their ephemeral shapes. So those collections of matter of
which animated things consist offer a plastic substance to be modified.
The number of individuals counts like the ripples of the sea.</p>


<p><span class="side">They constitute a series.</span>As external circumstances change, animated forms change with them, and
thus arises a series of which the members stand in a connected relation.
The affiliated sequence of the external circumstances is represented in
the affiliated succession of living types. From parts, or from things
already existing, new parts and new things emerge, the new not being
added or juxtaposed to the old, but evolved or developed from it. From
the homogeneous or general, the heterogeneous or special is brought
forth. A new member, fashioned in secrecy and apart, is never abruptly
ingrafted on any living thing. New animal types have never been suddenly
located among old ones, but have emerged from them by process of
transmutation. As certainly as that every living thing must die, so must
it reach perfection by passing through a succession of subordinate forms.
An individual, or even a species, is only a zoological phase in a passage
to something beyond. An instantaneous adult, like an immortal animal, is
a physiological impossibility.</p>


<p><span class="side">The doctrine of progressive improvement.</span>This bringing forth of structure from structure, of function from
function, incidentally presents, upon the whole, an appearance of
progressive improvement, and for such it has been not unfrequently
mistaken. Thus if the lowest animals, which move by reflex action
instantly but unconsciously, when an impression is made upon them, be
compared with the higher ones, whose motions are executed under the
influence of antecedent impressions, and are therefore controlled by
ideas, there seems to have been such an improvement. Still, however, it
is altogether of a physical kind. Every impression of which the dog or
elephant is conscious implies change in the nerve centres, and these
changes are at the basis of the memory displayed by those animals. Our
own experience furnishes many illustrations. When we gaze steadfastly on
some brightly-illuminated object, and then close or turn aside our eyes,
a fading <span class="pag">[364]</span> impression <a id="of364"></a>of the object at which we have been looking still
remains; or, when a spark is made to revolve rapidly, we think we see a
circle of fire, the impression upon the retina lasting until the spark
has completed its revolution. In like manner, though far more perfectly,
are impressions registered or stored up in the sensory ganglia, the
phantoms of realities that have once been seen. In those organs countless
images may thus be superposed.</p>


<p><span class="side">Analogies between animals and man.</span>Man agrees with animals thus approaching him in anatomical construction
in many important respects. He, too, represents a continuous succession
of matter, a continuous expenditure of power. Impressions of external
things are concealed in his sensory ganglia, to be presented for
inspection in subsequent times, and to constitute motives of action. But
he differs from them in this, that what was preparatory and rudimentary
in them is complete and perfect in him. From the instrument of instinct
there has been developed an instrument of intellection. In the most
perfect quadrupeds, an external stimulus is required to start a train of
thought, which then moves on in a determinate way, their actions
indicating that, under the circumstances, they reason according to the
same rules as man, drawing conclusions more or less correct from the
facts offered to their notice. But, the instrument of intellection
completed, it is quickly brought into use, and now results of the highest
order appear. The succession of ideas is under control; new trains can be
originated not only by external causes, but also by an interior, a
spontaneous influence. The passive has become active. Animals remember,
man alone recollects. Every thing demonstrates that the development and
completion of this instrument of intellection has been followed by the
super-addition of an agent or principle that can use it.</p>


<p><span class="side">Points of distinction between them.</span>There is, then, a difference between the brutes and man, not only as
respects constitution, but also as respects destiny. Their active force
merges into other mundane forces and disappears, but the special
principle given to him endures. We willingly persuade ourselves that this
principle is actually personified, and that the shades of the dead
resemble <span class="pag">[365]</span> their <a id="living365"></a>living forms. To Eastern Asia, where philosophy has been
accustomed to the abstract idea of force, the pleasures we derive from
this contemplation are denied, the cheerless doctrine of Buddhism
likening the life of man to the burning of a lamp, and death to its
extinction. Perceiving in the mutation of things, as seen in the narrow
range of human vision, a suggestion of the variations and distribution of
power throughout nature, it rises to a grand, and, it must be added, an
awful conception of the universe.</p>

<p>But Europe, and also the Mohammedan nations of Asia, have not received
with approbation that view.
<span class="side">The human soul.</span>
To them there is an individualized
impersonation of the soul, and an expectation of its life hereafter. The
animal fabric is only an instrument for its use. The eye is the window
through which that mysterious principle perceives: through the ear are
brought to its attention articulate sounds and harmonies; by the other
organs the sensible qualities of bodies are made known. From the silent
chambers and winding labyrinths of the brain the veiled enchantress looks
forth on the outer world, and holds the subservient body in an
irresistible spell.</p>


<p><span class="side">Extension of these views to the nature of the world.</span>This difference between the Oriental and European ideas respecting the
nature of man reappears in their ideas respecting the nature of the
world. The one sees in it only a gigantic engine, in which stars and orbs
are diffusing power and running through predestined mutations. The other,
with better philosophy and a higher science, asserts a personal God, who
considers and orders events in a vast panorama before him.</p>

<p> <span class="pag">[366]</span> The Age of Reason in Europe presents all the peculiarities of the Age of
Reason in Greece. There are modern representatives of King Ptolemy
Philadelphus among his furnaces and crucibles; of Hipparchus cataloguing
the stars; of Aristyllus and Timochares, with their stone quadrants and
armils, ascertaining the planetary motions; of Eratosthenes measuring the
size of the earth; of Herophilus dissecting the human body; of Archimedes
settling the laws of mechanics and hydrostatics; of Manetho collating the
annals of the old dynasties of Egypt; of Euclid and Apollonius improving
mathematics.
<span class="side">Analogies between the Age of Reason in Europe and in Greece.</span>
 There are botanical gardens and zoological menageries like
those of Alexandria, and expeditions to the sources of the Nile. The
direction of thought is the same; but the progress is on a greater scale,
and illustrated by more imposing results. The <span class="pag">[367]</span> exploring <a id="voyages367"></a>voyages to
Madagascar are replaced by circumnavigations of the world; the revolving
steam-engine of Hero by the double-acting engine of Watt; the great
galley of Ptolemy, with its many banks of rowers, by the ocean
steam-ship; the solitary watch-fire on the Pharos by a thousand
light-houses, with their fixed and revolving lights; the courier on his
Arab horse by the locomotive and electric telegraph; the scriptorium in
the Serapion, with its shelves of papyrus, by countless printing-presses;
the "Almagest" of Ptolemy by the "Principia" of Newton; and the Museum
itself by English, French, Italian, German, Dutch, and Russian
philosophical societies, universities, colleges, and other institutions
of learning.</p>


<p><span class="side">European progress in the acquisition of knowledge.</span>
So grand is the scale on which this cultivation of science has been
resumed, so many are those engaged in it, so rapid is the advance, and so
great are the material advantages, that there is no difficulty in
appreciating the age of which it is the characteristic. The most
superficial outline enables us to recognize at once its resemblance to
that period of Greek life to which I have referred. To bring its features
into relief, I shall devote a few pages to a cursory review of the
progress of some of the departments of science, selecting for the purpose
topics of general interest.</p>

<p>First, then, as respects the atmosphere, and the phenomena connected with
it.</p>


<p><span class="side">The atmosphere.</span>From observations on the twilight, the elasticity of aerial bodies, and
the condensing action of cold, the conclusion previously arrived at by
Alhazen was established, that the atmosphere does not extend unlimitedly
into space. Its height is considered to be about forty-five miles. From
its compressibility, the greater part of it is within a much smaller
limit; were it of uniform density, it would not extend more than 29,000
feet. Hence, comparing it with the dimensions of the earth, it is an
insignificant aerial shell, in thickness not the eightieth part of the
distance to the earth's centre, and its immensity altogether an illusion.
It bears about the same proportion to the earth, that the down upon a
peach bears to the peach itself.</p>

<p>A foundation for the mechanical theory of the atmosphere <span class="pag">[368]</span> was laid as
soon as just ideas respecting liquid pressures, as formerly taught by
Archimedes, were restored, the conditions of vertical and oblique
pressures investigated, the demonstration of equality of pressures in all
directions given, and the proof furnished that the force of a liquid on
the bottom of a vessel may be very much greater than its weight.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its mechanical relations.</span>Such of these conclusions as were applicable were soon transferred to the
case of aerial bodies. The weight of the atmosphere was demonstrated, its
pressure illustrated and measured; then came the dispute about the action
of pumps, and the overthrow of the Aristotelian doctrine of the horror of
a vacuum. Coincidently occurred the invention of the barometer, and the
proof of its true theory, both on a steeple in Paris and on a mountain in
Auvergne. The invention of the air-pump, and its beautiful illustrations
of the properties of the atmosphere, extended in a singular manner the
taste for natural philosophy.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its chemical relations.</span>The mechanics of the air was soon followed by its chemistry. From remote
ages it had been numbered among the elements, though considered liable to
vitiation or foulness. The great discovery of oxygen gas placed its
chemical relations in their proper position. One after another, other
gases, both simple and compound, were discovered. Then it was recognized
that the atmosphere is the common receptacle for all gases and vapours,
and the problem whether, in the course of ages, it has ever undergone
change in its constitution arose for solution.</p>


<p><span class="side">The antagonism of animals and plants.</span>The negative determination of that problem, so far as a few thousand
years are concerned, was necessarily followed by a recognition of the
antagonism of animals and plants, and their mutually balancing each
other, the latter accomplishing their duty under the influence of the
sun, though he is a hundred millions of miles distant. From this it
appeared that it is not by incessant interventions that the sum total of
animal life is adjusted to that of vegetable, but that, in this respect,
the system of government of the world is by the operation of natural
causes and law, a conclusion the more imposing since it contemplates all
living things, <span class="pag">[369]</span> and <a id="includes369"></a>includes even man himself. The detail of these
investigations proved that the organic substance of plants is condensed
from the inorganic air to which that of all animals returns, the
particles running in ever-repeating cycles, now in the air, now in
plants, now in animals, now in the air again, the impulse of movement
being in the sun, from whom has come the force incorporated in plant
tissues, and eventually disengaged in our fires, shining in our flames,
oppressing us in fevers, and surprising us in blushes.</p>


<p><span class="side">The winds; their origin and nature.</span>Organic disturbances by respiration and the growth of plants being in the
lowest stratum of the air, its uniformity of composition would be
impossible were it not for the agency of the winds and the diffusion of
gases, which it was found would take place under any pressure. The winds
were at length properly referred to the influence of the sun, whose heat
warms the air, causing it to ascend, while other portions flow in below.
The explanation of land and sea breezes was given, and in the trade-wind
was found a proof of the rotation of the earth. At a later period
followed the explanation of monsoons in the alternate heating and cooling
of Asia and Africa on opposite sides of the line, and of tornadoes, which
are disks of air rotating round a translated axis with a diameter of one
hundred or one hundred and fifty miles, the axis moving in a curvilinear
track with a progressive advance of twenty or twenty-five miles an hour,
and the motions being in opposite directions in opposite hemispheres of
the globe.</p>

<p>The equatorial calms and trade-winds accounted for on physical
principles, it was admitted that the winds of high latitudes,
proverbially uncertain as they are, depend in like manner on physical
causes.</p>

<p>With these palpable movements there are others of a less obvious kind.
Through the air, and by reason of motions in it, sounds are transmitted
to us.</p>


<p><span class="side">Of sounds; their velocity.</span>The Alexandrian mathematicians made sound a favourite study. Modern
acoustics arose from the recognition that there is nothing issuing from
the sounding body, but that its parts are vibrating and affecting the
medium between it and the ear. Not <span class="pag">[370]</span> only <a id="by370"></a>by the air-pump, but also by
observations in the rare atmosphere of the upper regions, it was shown
that the intensity of sound depends upon the density. On the top of a
mountain the report of a pistol is no louder than that of a cracker in
the valley. As to the gradual propagation of sounds, it was impossible to
observe fire-arms discharged at a distance without noticing that the
flash appears longer before the report in proportion as the distance is
greater. The Florentine academicians attempted a determination of the
velocity, and found it to be 1148 feet in a second. More accurate and
recent experiments made it 1089·42 feet at the freezing-point of water;
but the velocity, though independent of the density, increases with the
temperature at the rate of 1·14 foot for each degree. For other media the
rate is different; for water, about 4687 feet in a second, and in cast
iron about 10 &frac12; times greater than in air. All sounds, irrespective of
their note or intensity, move at the same velocity, the medium itself
being motionless in the mass. No sound can pass through a vacuum. The
sudden aerial condensation attending the propagation of a sound gives
rise to a momentary evolution of heat, which increases the elasticity of
the air, and hence the velocity is higher than 916 feet in a second,
otherwise the theoretical rate.</p>


<p><span class="side">Acoustic phenomena.</span>Turning from soniferous media to sounding bodies, it was shown that the
difference between acute and grave sounds depends on the frequency of
vibration. The ear can not perceive a sound originating in less than
thirty-two vibrations in a second, nor one of more than 24,000. The
actual number of vibrations in a given note was counted by means of
revolving wheels and other contrivances. I have not space to relate the
investigation of many other acoustic facts, the reference of sounds to
phases of condensation, and rarefaction in the elastic medium taking
place in a normal direction; the affections of note, intensity, quality;
the passage in curved lines and around obstacles; the production of
sympathetic sounds; nodal points; the effect of reeds; the phenomena of
pipes and flutes, and other wind instruments; the various vibrations of
solids, as bells; or of membranes, as drums; visible acoustic lines; the
reflexion of <span class="pag">[371]</span> undulations <a id="by371"></a>by surfaces of various forms; their
interferences, so that, no matter how intense they may be individually,
they can be caused to produce silence; nor of whispering galleries,
echoes, the nature of articulate sounds, the physiology of the vocal and
auditory organs of man, and the construction of speaking machines.</p>


<p><span class="side">The ocean; its size.</span>Like the air, the ocean, which covers three-fourths of the earth's
surface, when reduced to a proper standard of measure, loses very much of
its imposing aspect. The varnish that covers a twelve-inch globe
represents its relative dimension not inadequately.</p>


<p><span class="side">Tides and currents.</span>On the theory of gravitation, the tides of the ocean were explained as
depending on the attractive force of the sun and moon. Its currents, in a
general manner, are analogous to those of the air. They originate in the
disturbing action of solar heat, the temperature of the sea varying from
85° in the torrid zone to the freezing-point as the poles are approached.
Its specific gravity at the equator is estimated at 1·028; but this
density necessarily varies with the rate at which superficial evaporation
takes place; the pure vapour rising, leaves a more concentrated salt
solution. The effect is therefore, in some degree, to counteract the
expansion of the water by warmth, for the sun-rays, being able to
penetrate several feet below the surface, correspondingly raise the
temperature of that portion, which expands and becomes lighter; but,
simultaneously, surface evaporation tends to make the water heavier.
Notwithstanding this, currents are established through the preponderance
of the dilatation, and of them the Gulf Stream is to us the most striking
example.</p>


<p><span class="side">Effects of ocean streams.</span>The physical action of the sun-rays in occasioning currents operates
through the expansion of water, of which warm portions ascend to the
surface, colder portions from beneath setting in to supply their place.
These currents, both hot and cold, are affected by the diurnal rotation
of the earth, the action being essentially the same as that for the
winds. They exert so great an influence as conveyers of heat that they
disturb the ordinary climate relation depending on the sun's position. In
this way the Gulf Stream, a river <span class="pag">[372]</span> of <a id="hot372"></a>hot water in a sea of cold, as soon
as it spreads out on the surface of the Atlantic in higher latitudes,
liberates into the air the heat it has brought from the torrid zone; and
this, being borne by the southwest wind, which blows in those localities
for the greater part of the year, to the westerly part of the European
continent, raises by many degrees the mean annual temperature, thus not
only regulating the distribution of animals and plants, but also
influencing human life and its pursuits, making places pleasant that
would otherwise be inclement, and even facilitating the progress of
civilization. Whatever, therefore, can affect the heat, the volume, the
velocity, the direction of such a stream, at once produces important
consequences in the organic world.</p>


<p><span class="side">Physical and chemical relations of water.</span>The Alexandrian school had attained correct ideas respecting the
mechanical properties of water as the type of liquids. This knowledge
was, however, altogether lost in Europe for many ages, and not regained
until the time of Stevinus and Galileo, who recovered correct views of
the nature of pressure, both vertical and oblique, and placed the
sciences of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics on exact foundations. The
Florentine academicians, from their experiments on water inclosed in a
globe of gold, concluded that it is incompressible, an error subsequently
corrected, and its compressibility measured. The different states in
which it occurs, as ice, water, steam, were shown to depend altogether on
the amount of latent heat it contains. Out of these investigations
originated the invention of the steam-engine, of which it may be said
that it has revolutionized the industry of the world. Soon after the
explanation of the cause of its three states followed the great discovery
that the opinion of past ages respecting its elementary nature is
altogether erroneous. It is not a simple element, but is composed of two
ingredients, oxygen and hydrogen, as was rigorously proved by decomposing
and forming it. By degrees, more correct views of the nature of
evaporation were introduced; gases and vapours were found to coexist in
the same space, not because of their mutual solvent power, but because of
their individual and independent elasticity. The instantaneous <span class="pag">[373]</span> formation
<a id="of373"></a>of vapours in a vacuum showed that the determining condition is heat, the
weight of vapour capable of existing in a given space being proportional
to the temperature. More scientific views of the nature of maximum
density were obtained, and on these principles was effected the essential
improvement of the low pressure steam-engine&mdash;the apparent paradox of
condensing the steam without cooling the cylinder.</p>

<p>In like manner much light was cast on the meteorological functions of
water. It was seen that the diurnal vaporization from the earth depends
on the amount of heat received, the vapour rising invisibly in the air
till it reaches a region where the temperature is sufficiently low. There
condensation into vesicles of perhaps <sup class="topnum">1</sup>/<sup class="botnum">50000</sup> of an inch in diameter
ensues, and of myriads of such globules a cloud is composed.
<span class="side">Clouds and their nomenclature.</span>
Of clouds, notwithstanding their many forms and aspects, a classification was
given&mdash;cirrus, cumulus, stratus, etc. It was obvious why some dissolve
away and disappear when they encounter warmer or drier spaces, and why
others descend as rain. It was shown that the drops can not be pure,
since they come in contact with dust, soluble gases, and organic matter
in the air.
<span class="side">The return of water to the sea.</span>
Sinking into the ground, the water issues forth as springs,
contaminated with whatever is in the soil, and finds its way, through
streamlets and rivers, back to the sea, and thus the drainage of
countries is accomplished. Through such a returning path it comes to the
receptacle from which it set out; the heat of the sun raised it from the
ocean, the attraction of the earth returns it thereto; and, since the
heat-supply is invariable from year to year, the quantity set in motion
must be the same. Collateral results of no little importance attend these
movements. Every drop of rain falling on the earth disintegrates and
disturbs portions of the soil; every stream carries solid matter into the
sea. It is the province of geology to estimate the enormous aggregate of
detritus, continents washed away and new continents formed, and the face
of the earth remodelled and renewed.</p>


<p><span class="side">Progress of chemistry.</span>The artificial decomposition of water constitutes an epoch in chemistry.
The European form of this <span class="pag">[374]</span> science, <a id="in374"></a>in contradistinction to the Arabian,
arose from the doctrine of acids and alkalies, and their neutralization.
This was about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;1614. It was perceived that the union of bodies is
connected with the possession of opposite qualities, and hence was
introduced the idea of an attraction of affinity. On this the discovery
of elective attraction followed. Then came the recognition that this
attraction is connected with opposite electrical states, chemistry and
electricity approaching each other. A train of splendid discoveries
followed; metals were obtained light enough to float on water, and even
apparently to accomplish the proverbial impossibility of setting it on
fire. In the end it was shown that the chemical force of electricity is
directly proportional to its absolute quantity.
<span class="side">Attraction. The elements. </span>
 Better views of the
nature of chemical attraction were attained, better views of the
intrinsic nature of bodies. The old idea of four elements was discarded,
as also the Saracenic doctrine of salt, sulphur, and mercury. The
elements were multiplied until at length they numbered more than sixty.
<span class="side">Theory of phlogiston.</span>
Alchemy merged into chemistry through the theory of phlogiston, which
accounted for the change that metals undergo when exposed to the fire on
the principle that something was driven off from them&mdash;a something that
might be restored again by the action of combustible bodies. It is
remarkable how adaptive this theory was. It was found to include the
cases of combustive operations, the production of acids, the breathing of
animals. It maintained its ground even long after the discovery of oxygen
gas, of which one of the first names was dephlogisticated air.</p>

<p>But a false theory always contains within itself the germ of its own
destruction. The weak point of this was, that when a metal is burnt the
product ought to be lighter than the metal, whereas it proves heavier.
<span class="side">Introduction of the balance into chemistry.</span>
At length it was detected that what the metal had gained the surrounding air
had lost. This discovery implied that the balance had been resorted to
for the determination of weights and for the decision of physical
questions. The reintroduction of that instrument&mdash;for, as we have <span class="pag">[375]</span> seen,
it had <a id="ages375"></a>ages before been employed by the Saracen philosophers, who used
several different forms of it&mdash;marked the epoch when chemistry ceased to
be exclusively a science of quality and became one of quantity.</p>


<p><span class="side">Theory of oxygen, and the nomenclature.</span>On the ruins of the phlogistic theory arose the theory of oxygen, which
was sustained with singular ability. Its progress was greatly facilitated
by the promulgation of a new nomenclature in conformity to its
principles, and of remarkable elegance and power. In the course of time
it became necessary, however, to modify the theory, especially by
deposing oxygen from the attitude of sovereignty to which it had been
elevated, and assigning to it several colleagues, such as chlorine,
iodine, etc. The introduction of the balance was also followed by
important consequences in theoretical chemistry, among which
pre-eminently was the establishment of the laws of combinations of
bodies.</p>


<p><span class="side">Present state of chemistry.</span>Extensive and imposing as is the structure of chemistry, it is very far
from its completion. It is so surrounded by the scaffolding its builders
are using, it is so deformed with the materials of their work, that its
true plan can not yet be made out. In this respect it is far more
backward than astronomy. It has, however, disposed of the idea of the
destruction and creation of matter.
<span class="side">Indestructibility of matter.</span>
It accepts without hesitation the
doctrine of the imperishability of substance; for, though the aspect of a
thing may change through decompositions and recombinations, in which its
constituent parts are concerned, every atom continues to exist, and may
be recovered by suitable processes, though the entire thing may have
seemingly disappeared. A particle of water raised from the sea may ascend
invisibly through the air, it may float above us in the cloud, it may
fall in the rain-drop, sink into the earth, gush forth again in the
fountain, enter the rootlets of a plant, rise up with the sap to the
leaves, be there decomposed by the sunlight into its constituent
elements, its oxygen and hydrogen; of these and other elements, acids and
oils, and various organic compounds may be made: in these or in its
undecomposed state it may be received in the food of animals, circulate
in their blood, be <span class="pag">[376]</span> essentially <a id="concerned376"></a>concerned in acts of intellection
executed by the brain, it may be expired in the breath. Though shed in
the tear in moments of despair, it may give birth to the rainbow, the
emblem of hope. Whatever the course through which it has passed, whatever
mutations it has undergone, whatever the force it has submitted to, its
elementary constituents endure. Not only have they not been annihilated,
they have not even been changed; and in a period of time, long or short,
they find their way as water back again to the sea from which they came.</p>


<p><span class="side">Electrical discoveries.</span>Discoveries in electricity not only made a profound impression on
chemistry, they have taken no insignificant share in modifying human
opinion on other very interesting subjects. In all ages the lightning had
been looked upon with superstitious dread. The thunderbolt had long been
feigned to be the especial weapon of Divinity. A like superstitious
sentiment had prevailed respecting the northern lights universally
regarded in those countries in which they display themselves as glimpses
of the movements of the angelic host, the banners and weapons of the
armies of heaven. A great blow against superstition was struck when the
physical nature of these phenomena was determined. As to the connexion of
electrical science with the progress of civilization, what more needs to
be said than to allude to the telegraph?</p>


<p><span class="side">Theories of electricity.</span>It  is an illustration of the excellence and fertility of modern methods
that the phenomena of the attraction displayed by amber, which had been
known and neglected for two thousand years, in one-tenth of that time led
to surprising results.
<span class="side">Electrical phenomena. </span>
First it was shown that there are many other
bodies which will act in like manner; then came the invention of the
electrical machine, the discovery of electrical repulsion, and the spark;
the differences of conductibility in bodies; the apparently two species
of electricity, vitreous and resinous; the general law of attraction and
repulsion; the wonderful phenomena of the Leyden phial and the electric
shock; the demonstration of the identity of lightning and electricity;
the means of protecting buildings and ships by rods; the velocity of
electric movement&mdash;that immense distances can be passed through in an
inappreciable <span class="pag">[377]</span> time; <a id="the377"></a>the theory of one fluid and that of two; the
mathematical discussion of all the phenomena, first on one and then on
the other of these doctrines; the invention of the torsion balance; the
determination that the attractive and repulsive forces follow the law of
the inverse squares; the conditions of distribution on conductors; the
elucidation of the phenomena of induction.
<span class="side">Voltaic electricity.</span>
At length, when discovery
seemed to be pausing, the facts of galvanism were announced in Italy. Up
to this time it was thought that the most certain sign of the death of an
animal was its inability to exhibit muscular contraction: but now it was
shown that muscular movements could be excited in those that are dead and
even mutilated. Then followed quickly the invention of the Voltaic pile.
<span class="side">Results of the discovery of Galvani.</span>
Who could have foreseen that the twitching of a frog's leg in the Italian
experiments would establish beyond all question the compound nature of
water, separating its constituents from one another? would lead to the
deflagration and dissipation in a vapour of metals that could hardly be
melted in a furnace? would show that the solid earth we tread upon is an
oxide? yield new metals light enough to swim upon water, and even seem to
set it on fire? produce the most brilliant of all artificial lights,
rivalling if not excelling, in its intolerable splendour the noontide
sun? would occasion a complete revolution in chemistry, compelling that
science to accept new ideas, and even a new nomenclature? that it would
give us the power of making magnets capable of lifting more than a ton,
and cast a light on that riddle of ages, the pointing of the mariner's
compass north and south, explain the mutual attraction or repulsion of
magnetic needles? that it would enable us to form exquisitely in metal
casts of all kinds of objects of art, and give workmen a means of gilding
and silvering without risk to their health? that it would suggest to the
evil disposed the forging of bank notes, the sophisticating of jewelry,
and be invaluable in the uttering of false coinage? that it would carry
the messages of commerce and friendship instantaneously across continents
or under oceans, and "waft a sigh from Indus to the pole?"</p>

<p> <span class="pag">[378]</span> <a id="Yet378"></a>Yet this is only a part of what the Italian experiment, carried out by
modern methods, has actually done. Could there be a more brilliant
exhibition of their power, a brighter earnest of the future of material
philosophy?</p>


<p><span class="side">Discoveries in magnetism.</span>As it had been with amber, so with the magnet. Its properties had lain
uninvestigated for two thousand years, except in China, where the
observation had been made that its qualities may be imparted to steel,
and that a little bar or needle so prepared, if floated on the surface of
water or otherwise suspended, will point north and south. In that manner
the magnet had been applied in the navigation of ships, and in journeys
across trackless deserts. The first European magnetical discovery was
that of Columbus, who observed a line of no variation west of the Azores.
Then followed the detection of the dip, the demonstration of poles in the
needle, and of the law of attraction and repulsion; the magnetic voyage
undertaken by the English government; the construction of general
variation charts; the observation of diurnal variation; local
perturbations; the influence of the Aurora, which affects all the three
expressions of magnetical power; the disturbance of the horary motion
simultaneously over thousands of miles, as from Kasan to Paris. In the
meantime, the theory of magnetism improved as the facts came out. Its
germ was the Cartesian vortices, suggested by the curvilinear forms of
iron filings in the vicinity of magnetic poles. The subsequent
mathematical discussion was conducted upon the same principles as in the
case of electricity.</p>


<p><span class="side">Electro-magnetism.</span>Then came the Danish discovery of the relations of electricity and
magnetism, illustrated in England by rotatory motions, and in France
adorned by the electrodynamic theory, embracing the action of currents
and magnets, magnets and magnets, currents and currents. The generation
of magnetism by electricity was after a little delay followed by its
converse, the production of electricity by magnetism; and thermoelectric
currents, arising from the unequal application or propagation of heat,
were rendered serviceable in producing the most sensitive of all
thermometers.</p>



<p><span class="side">Of light and optics.</span> <span class="pag">[379]</span> <a id="The379"></a>The investigation of the nature and properties of light rivals in
interest and value that of electricity. What is this agent, light, which
clothes the earth with verdure, making animal life possible, extending
man's intellectual sphere, bringing to his knowledge the forms and
colours of things, and giving him information of the existence of
countless myriads of worlds? What is this light which, in the midst of so
many realities, presents him with so many delusive fictions, which rests
the coloured bow against the cloud&mdash;the bow once said, when men
transferred their own motives and actions to the Divinity, to be the
weapon of God?</p>


<p><span class="side">Optical discoveries.</span>The first ascertained optical fact was probably the propagation of light
in straight lines. The theory of perspective, on which the Alexandrian
mathematicians voluminously wrote, implies as much; but agreeably to the
early methods of philosophy, which were inclined to make man the centre
of all things, it was supposed that rays are emitted from the eye and
proceed outwardly, not that they come from exterior objects and pass
through the organ of vision inwardly. Even the great geometer Euclid
treated the subject on that erroneous principle, an error corrected by
the Arabians. In the meantime the law of reflexion had been discovered;
that for refraction foiled Alhazen, and was reserved for a European.
Among natural optical phenomena the form of the rainbow was accounted
for, notwithstanding a general belief in its supernatural origin. Its
colours, however, could not be explained until exact ideas of
refrangibility, dispersion, and the composition of white light were
attained. The reflecting telescope was invented; the recognized
possibility of achromatism led to an improvement in the refractor.
<span class="side">Colours and white light.</span>
 A little previously the progressive motion of light had been proved, first
for reflected light by the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, then for the
direct light of the stars. A true theory of colours originated with the
formation of the solar spectrum; that beautiful experiment led to the
discovery of irrationality of dispersion and the fixed lines. The
phenomena of refraction in the case of Iceland spar were examined, and
the law for the ordinary and <span class="pag">[380]</span> extraordinary <a id="rays380"></a>rays given. At the same time
the polarization of light by double refraction was discovered. A century
later it was followed by polarisation by reflexion and single refraction,
depolarization, irised rings, bright and black crosses in crystals, and
unannealed or compressed glass, the connexion between optical phenomena
and crystalline form, uniaxial crystals giving circular rings and biaxial
oval ones, and circular and elliptical polarization.</p>

<p>The beautiful colours of soap-bubbles, at first mixed up with those of
striated and dotted surfaces, were traced to their true
condition&mdash;thickness. The determination of thickness of a film necessary
to give a certain colour was the first instance of exceedingly minute
measures beautifully executed. These soon became connected with fringes
in shadows, and led to ascertaining the length of waves of light.</p>


<p><span class="side">Vision; the functions of the eye. </span>Meantime more correct ideas respecting vision were obtained. Alhazen's
explanation of the use of the retina and lens was adopted. This had been
the first truly scientific investigation in physiology. The action of the
eye was reduced to that of the camera-obscura described by Da Vinci, and
the old notion of rays issuing therefrom finally abandoned. It had held
its ground through the deceptive illustration of the magic-lantern. Of
this instrument the name indicates the popular opinion of its nature. In
the stories of necromancers and magicians of the time are to be found
traces of applications to which it was insidiously devoted&mdash;the raising
of the dead, spectres skipping along the ground or dancing on the walls
and chimneys, pendulous images, apparitions in volumes of smoke.
<span class="side">Optical instruments.</span>
These early instruments were the forerunners of many beautiful inventions of
later times&mdash;the kaleidoscope, producing its forms of marvellous
symmetry: the stereoscope, aided by photography, offering the very
embodiment of external scenery; the achromatic and reflecting telescope,
to which physical astronomy is so greatly indebted; and the achromatic
microscope, now working a revolution in anatomy and physiology.</p>


<p><span class="side">The undulatory theory.</span>In its theory optics has presented a striking contrast to acoustics.
Almost from the very beginning it was <span class="pag">[381]</span> recognized <a id="that381"></a>that sound is not a
material substance emitted from the sounding body, but only undulations
occurring in the air. For long, optics failed to reach an analogous
conclusion. The advancement of the former science has been from the
general principle down to the details, that of the latter from the
details up to the general principle.</p>

<p>That light consists of undulations in an elastic medium was first
inferred in 1664. Soon after, reflexion, refraction, and double
refraction were accounted for on that principle. The slow progress of
this theory was doubtless owing to Newton's supremacy. He gave a
demonstration in the second book of the "Principia" (Prop. 42) that wave
motions must diverge into the unmoved spaces, and carried popular
comprehension with him by such illustrations as that we hear sounds
though a mountain interpose. It was thought that the undulatory theory
was disposed of by the impossibility of seeing through a crooked pipe,
though we can hear through it; or that we cannot look round a corner,
though we can listen round one.</p>

<p>The present century finally established it through the discovery of
interference, the destruction of the emission theory being inevitable
when it was shown that light, interfering under certain circumstances
with light, may produce darkness, as sound added to sound may produce
silence&mdash;results arising from the action of undulating motion. The
difficulties presented by polarization were not only removed, but that
class of phenomena was actually made a strong support of the theory. The
discovery that two pencils of oppositely polarized light would not
interfere, led at once to the theory of transverse vibrations. Great
mathematical ability was now required for the treatment of the subject,
and the special consideration of many optical problems from this new
point of view, as, for example, determining the result of transverse
vibrations coming into a medium of different density in different
directions. As the theory of universal gravitation had formerly done, so
now the undulatory theory began to display its power as a physical truth,
enabling geometers to foresee results, and to precede the experimenter in
conclusions. Among earlier results of the <span class="pag">[382]</span> kind <a id="was382"></a>was the prediction that
both the rays in the biaxial crystal topaz are extraordinary, and that
circular polarization may be produced by reflexion in a rhomb of glass.
The phenomena of depolarization offered no special difficulty; and many
new facts, as those of elliptic polarization and conical refraction, have
since illustrated the power of the theory.</p>


<p><span class="side">The ether and its movements.</span>Light, then, is the result of ethereal undulations impinging on the eye.
There exists throughout the universe and among the particles of all
bodies an elastic medium, ether. By reason of the repulsion of its own
parts it is uniformly diffused in a vacuum. In the interior of refracting
media it exists in a state of less elasticity compared with its density
than in vacuo. Vibrations communicated to it in free space are propagated
through such media by the ether in their interior. The parts of shining
bodies vibrate as those of sounding ones, communicating their movement to
the ether, and giving rise to waves in it. They produce in us the
sensation of light. The slower the vibration, the longer the wave; the
more frequent, the shorter. On wave-length colour depends. In all cases
the vibrations are transverse. The undulatory movement passes onward at
the rate of 192,000 miles in a second. The mean length of a wave of light
is 0.0000219 of an inch; an extreme red wave is about twice as long as an
extreme violet one. The yellow is intermediate. The vibrations which thus
occasion light are, at a mean, 555 in the billionth of a second. As with
the air, which is motionless when a sound passes through it, the ether is
motionless, though traversed by waves of light. That which moves forward
is no material substance, but only a form, as the waves seen running
along a shaken cord, or the circles that rise and fall, and spread
outwardly when a stone is thrown into water. The wave-like form passes
onward to the outlying spaces, but the water does not rush forward. And
as we may have on the surface of that liquid waves the height of which is
insignificant, or those which, as sailors say, are mountains high in
storms at sea, their amplitude thus differing, so in the midst of the
ether difference of amplitude is manifested to us by difference in the
intensity or brilliancy of light.</p>


<p><span class="side">The human eye; its capabilities.</span> <span class="pag">[383]</span> <a id="The383"></a>The human eye, exquisitely constructed as it is, is nevertheless an
imperfect mechanism, being limited in its action. It can only perceive
waves of a definite length, as its fellow organ, the ear, can only
distinguish a limited range of sounds. It can only take note of
vibrations that are transverse, as the ear can only take note of those
that are normal. In optics there are two distinct orders of facts; the
actual relations of light itself, and the physiological relations of our
organ of vision, with all its limitations and imperfections. Light is
altogether the creation of the mind. The ether is one thing, light is
another, just as the air is one thing and sound another. The ether is not
composed of the colours of light any more than the atmospheric air
consists of musical notes.</p>


<p><span class="side">Chemical influences of light.</span>To the chemical agency of light much attention has in recent times been
devoted. Already in photography, it has furnished us an art which, though
yet in its infancy, presents exquisite representations of scenery, past
events, the countenances of our friends. In an almost magical way it
evokes invisible impressions, and gives duration to fleeting shadows.
Moreover, these chemical influences of light give birth to the whole
vegetable world, with all its varied charms of colour, form, and
property, and, as we have seen in the last chapter, on them animal life
itself depends.</p>


<p><span class="side">Of heat; reflexion; refraction.</span>The conclusions arrived at in optics necessarily entered as fundamental
ideas in thermotics, or the science of heat; for radiant heat moves also
in straight lines, undergoes reflexion, refraction, double refraction,
polarization, and hence the theory of transverse vibrations applies to
it. Heat is invisible light, as light is visible heat. Correct notions of
radiation originated with the Florentine academicians, who used concave
mirrors; and, in the cold-ray experiment, masses of ice of five hundred
pounds weight. The refraction of invisible heat was ascertained in
consequence of the invention of the thermoelectric pile. Its polarization
and depolarization soon followed. Already had been demonstrated the
influence of the physical state of radiant surfaces, and that the heat
comes also from a little depth beneath them.
<span class="side">Exchanges of heat.</span>
  <span class="pag">[384]</span> <a id="The384"></a>The felicitous doctrine of exchanges of heat imparted true ideas of the
nature of calorific equilibrium and the heating and cooling of bodies,
and offered an explanation of many phenomena, as, for instance, the
formation of dew.
<span class="side">The dew, nature of.</span>
 This deposit of moisture occurs after sunset, the more
copiously the clearer the sky; it never appears on a cloudy night; it
neither ascends from the ground like an exhalation, nor descends like a
rain. It shows preferences in its manner of settling, being found on some
objects before it is on others. All these singular peculiarities were
satisfactorily explained, and another of the mysteries, the unaccountable
wonders of the Middle Ages, brought into the attitude of a simple
physical fact.</p>


<p><span class="side">Incandescence. Physical instruments.</span>It is impossible, in a limited space, to relate satisfactorily what has
been done respecting ignition, the production of light by incandescence,
the accurate measurement of the conductibility of bodies, the
determination of the expansions of solids, liquids, gases, under
increasing temperature, the variations of the same substance at different
degrees, the heat of fluidity and elasticity, and specific heat, or to do
justice to the great improvements made in all kinds of
instruments&mdash;balances, thermometers, contrivances for linear and angular
measures, telescopes, microscopes, spectroscopes, chronometers,
aerostats, telegraphs, and machinery generally.
<span class="side">Effect of mechanical inventions.</span>
The tendency in every
direction has been to practical applications. More accurate knowledge
implies increasing power, greater wealth, higher virtue. The morality of
man is enhanced by the improvement of his intellect and by personal
independence. Our age has become rational, industrial, progressive. In
its great physical inventions Europe may securely trust. There is nothing
more to fear from Arabian invasions or Tartar irruptions. The hordes of
Asia could be swept away like chaff before the wind. Let him who would
form a correct opinion of the position of man in the present and
preceding phases of his progress reflect on the losses of Christendom in
Asia and Africa, in spite of all the machinery of an Age of Faith, and
the present security of Europe from every barbarian or foreign attack.</p>

<p> <span class="pag">[385]</span> <a id="From385"></a>From almost any of the branches of industry facts might be presented
illustrating the benefits arising from the application of physical
discoveries. As an example, I may refer to the cotton manufacture.</p>


<p><span class="side">Illustration from the cotton manufacture.</span>In a very short time after the mechanical arts were applied to the
manufacture of textile fabrics, so great was the improvement that a man
could do more work in a day than he had previously done in a year. That
manufacture was moreover accompanied by such collateral events as
actually overturned the social condition throughout Europe. Among these
were the invention of the steam-engine, the canal system, the prodigious
development of the iron manufacture, the locomotive, and railroads;
results not due to the placemen and officers to whom that continent had
resigned its annals, whose effigies encumber the streets of its cities,
but to men in the lower walks of life. The assertion is true that James
Watt, the instrument maker, conferred on his native country more solid
benefits than all the treaties she ever made and all the battles she ever
won. Arkwright was a barber, Harrison a carpenter, Brindley a
millwright's apprentice.</p>


<p><span class="side">Development of the cotton manufacture in England.</span>By the labours of Paul or of Wyatt, who introduced the operation of
spinning by rollers, a principle perfected by Arkwright; by the rotating
carding-engine, first devised by Paul; by the jenny of Highs or
Hargreaves; the water-frame; the mule, invented by Crompton, so greatly
was the cotton manufacture developed as to demand an entire change in the
life of operatives, and hence arose the factory system.
<span class="side">The steam-engine of Watt.</span>
At a critical
moment was introduced Watt's invention, the steam-engine. His first
patent was taken out in 1769, the same year that Arkwright patented
spinning by rollers. Watt's improvement chiefly consisted in the use of a
separate condenser, and the replacement of atmospheric pressure by that
of steam. Still, it was not until more than twenty years after that this
engine was introduced into factories, and hence it was not, as is
sometimes supposed, the cause of their wonderful increase. It came,
however, at a fortunate time, nearly coincident with the invention of the
dressing-machine by Radcliffe and the power-loom by Cartwright.</p>


<p><span class="side">Bleaching by chlorine.</span> <span class="pag">[386]</span>  <a id="If386"></a>If
the production of textile fabrics received such advantages from
mechanics, equally was it favoured by chemistry in the discovery of
bleaching by chlorine. To bleach a piece of cotton by the action of the
air and the sun required from six to eight months, and a large surface of
land must be used as a bleach-field. The value of land in the vicinity of
great towns presented an insuperable obstacle to such uses. By chlorine
the operation could be completed in the course of a few hours, and in a
comparatively small building, the fibre being beautifully and permanently
whitened.
<span class="side">Calico-printing by cylinders.</span>
Nor were the chemical improvements restricted to this.
Calico-printing, an art practised many thousand years ago among the
Egyptians, was perfected by the operation of printing from cylinders.</p>

<p>It deserves to be remarked that the cotton manufacture was first
introduced into Europe by the Arabs. Abderrahman&nbsp;III., <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>&nbsp;930, caused
it to be commenced in Spain; he also had extensive manufactures of silk
and leather, and interested himself much in the culture of the sugar
cane, rice, the mulberry. One of the most valuable Spanish applications
of cotton was in the invention of cotton paper. The Arabs were also the
authors of the printing of calicoes by wooden blocks, a great improvement
on the old Indian operation of painting by hand.</p>


<p><span class="side">Extent of the cotton manufacture.</span>We may excuse the enthusiastic literature of the cotton manufacture its
boasting, for men had accomplished works that were nearly God-like. Mr.
Baines, writing in 1833, states that the length of yarn spun in one year
was nearly five thousand millions of miles, sufficient to pass round the
earth's circumference more than two hundred thousand times&mdash;sufficient to
reach fifty-one times from the earth to the sun. It would encircle the
earth's orbit eight and a half times. The wrought fabrics of cotton
exported in one year would form a girdle for the globe passing eleven
times round the equator, more than sufficient to form a continuous sheet
from the earth to the moon. And, if this was the case thirty years ago,
by what illustrations would it be possible to depict it now (1859), when
the quantity of cotton imported by England alone is more than twelve
hundred millions of pounds?</p>


<p><span class="side">Improvements in locomotion.</span> <span class="pag">[387]</span> <a id="But387"></a>But such a vast development in that particular manufacture necessarily
implied other improvements, especially in locomotion and the transmission
of intelligence. The pedlar's pack, the pack-horse, and the cart became
altogether inadequate, and, in succession, were replaced by the canal
system of the last century, and by the steam-boats and railroads of this.
<span class="side">Brindley's canals.</span>
The engineering triumphs of Brindley, whose canals were carried across
valleys, over or through mountains, above rivers, excited unbounded
admiration in his own times, and yet they were only the precursors of the
railway engineering of ours. As it was, the canal system proved to be
inadequate to the want, and oaken railways, which had long been used in
quarries and coal-pits, with the locomotive invented by Murdoch in 1784,
were destined to supplant them.
<span class="side">Stephenson's locomotives.</span>
It does not fall within my present
purpose to relate how the locomotion of the whole civilized world was
revolutionized, not by the act of some mighty sovereign or soldier, but
by George Stephenson, once a steam-engine stoker, who, by the invention
of the tubular boiler and the ingenious device of blowing the chimney
instead of the fire, converted the locomotive of the last century, which,
at its utmost speed, could only travel seven miles an hour, into the
locomotive of this, which can accomplish seventy.
<span class="side">The railway system.</span>
 I need not dwell on the collateral improvements,
the introduction of iron for rails, metallic bridges, tubular bridges,
viaducts, and all the prodigies of the existing system of railway
engineering.</p>



<p><span class="side">Improvement in the construction of machinery.</span>It is not only on account of the gigantic nature of the work it has to
execute that the machinery employed in the great manufactures, such as
those of cotton and iron, is so worthy of our admiration; improvements as
respects the correctness, and even the elegance of its own construction,
attract our attention. It has been truly said of steam-engines that they
were never properly made until they made themselves. In any machine, the
excellence of its performance depends on the accuracy of its
construction. Its parts must be made perfectly true, and, to work
smoothly, must work without error. To accomplish such conditions taxed
<span class="pag">[388]</span> to <a id="its388"></a>its utmost the mechanical ingenuity of the last century; and, indeed,
it was not possible to reach perfect success so long as the hand alone
was resorted to. Work executed by the most skilful mechanic could be no
more than approximately correct. Not until such machines as the sliding
rest and planing engine were introduced could any approach to perfection
be made. Improvements of this nature reacted at once on the primary
construction of machinery, making it more powerful, more accurate, more
durable, and also led to the introduction of greater elegance in its
planning or conception, as any one may see who will compare the clumsy
half wooden, half metal machinery of the last century with the light and
tasteful constructions of this.</p>


<p><span class="side">Social changes effected by machinery.</span>While thus the inventive class of men were gratifying their mental
activity, and following that pursuit which has ever engrossed the
energetic in all ages of the world&mdash;the pursuit of riches; for it was
quickly perceived that success in this direction was the high road to
wealth, public consideration, and honour&mdash;the realization of riches
greater than the wildest expectations of the alchemists; there were
silently and in an unobserved manner great social and national results
arising. The operative was correct enough in his conclusion that
machinery was throwing him out of work, and reflecting persons were right
enough in their belief that this extensive introduction of machines was
in some way accomplishing a disorganization of the social economy.
Doubtless, for the time being, the distress and misery were very severe;
men were compelled to starve or to turn to new avocations; families were
deprived of their long-accustomed means of support; such must necessarily
be the incidents of every great social change, even though it be a change
of improvement. Nor was it until the new condition of things had passed
through a considerable advance that its political tendency began to be
plainly discerned. It was relieving the labourer from the burden of his
toil, supplanting manual by mechanical action.
<span class="side">Life in the mill.</span>
In the cotton-mill, which
may be looked upon as the embodiment of the new system and its
tendencies, the steam-engine down below was doing <span class="pag">[389]</span> the <a id="drudgery389"></a>drudgery, turning
the wheels and executing the labour, while the operatives above&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;were engaged in those things which the engine could
not accomplish&mdash;things requiring observation and intelligent action.
Under such a state it was not possible but that a social change should
ensue, for relief from corporeal labour is always followed by a
disposition for mental activity; and it was not without a certain degree
of plausibility that the philanthropist, whose attention was directed to
this subject, asserted that the lot of the labouring man was no better
than it had been before: he had changed the tyrant, but had not got rid
of the tyranny; for the demands of the insatiate, inexorable, untiring
steam-engine must be without delay satisfied; the broken thread must be
instantly pieced; the iron fingers must receive their new supply; the
finished work must be forthwith taken away.</p>


<p><span class="side">Intellectual activity.</span>What was thus going on in the mill was a miniature picture of what was
going on in the state. Labour was comparatively diminishing, mental
activity increasing. Throughout the last century the intellectual advance
is most significantly marked, and surprising is the contrast between the
beginning and the close. Ideas that once had a living force altogether
died away, the whole community offering an exemplification of the fact
that the more opportunity men have for reflection the more they will
think. Well, then, might those whose interests lay in the perpetuation of
former ideas and the ancient order of things look with intolerable
apprehension on what was taking place. They saw plainly that this
intellectual activity would at last find a political expression, and that
a power, daily increasing in intensity, would not fail to make itself
felt in the end.</p>


<p><span class="side">Difference between past and present ages.</span>In such things are manifested the essential differences between the Age
of Faith and the Age of Reason. In the former, if life was enjoyed in
calmness it was enjoyed in stagnation, in unproductiveness, and in a
worthless way. But how different in the latter! Every thing is in
movement. So many are the changes we witness, even in the course of a
very brief period, that no one, though of the <span class="pag">[390]</span> largest <a id="intellect390"></a>intellect, or in
the most favourable position, can predict the future of only a few years
hence. We see that ideas which yesterday served us as a guide die to-day,
and will be replaced by others, we know not what, to-morrow.</p>


<p><span class="side">Scientific contributions of various nations,</span>
In this scientific advancement, among the triumphs of which we are
living, all the nations of Europe have been engaged. Some, with a venial
pride, claim for themselves the glory of having taken the lead. But
perhaps each of them, if it might designate the country&mdash;alas! not yet a
nation&mdash;that should occupy the succeeding post of honour, would inscribe
Italy on its ballot.
<span class="side"> especially of Italy.</span>
It was in Italy that Columbus was born; in Venice,
destined one day to be restored to Italy, newspapers were first issued.
It was in Italy that the laws of the descent of bodies to the earth and
of the equilibrium of fluids were first determined by Galileo. In the
Cathedral of Pisa that illustrious philosopher watched the swinging of
the chandelier, and, observing that its vibrations, large and small, were
made in equal times, left the house of God, his prayers unsaid, but the
pendulum clock invented. To the Venetian senators he first showed the
satellites of Jupiter, the crescent form of Venus, and, in the garden of
Cardinal Bandini, the spots upon the sun. It was in Italy that Sanctorio
invented the thermometer; that Torricelli constructed the barometer and
demonstrated the pressure of the air. It was there that Castelli laid the
foundation of hydraulics and discovered the laws of the flowing of water.
There, too, the first Christian astronomical observatory was established,
and there Stancari counted the number of vibrations of a string emitting
musical notes. There Grimaldi discovered the diffraction of light, and
the Florentine academicians showed that dark heat may be reflected by
mirrors across space. In our own times Melloni furnished the means of
proving that it may be polarized. The first philosophical societies were
the Italian; the first botanical garden was established at Pisa; the
first classification of plants given by Cæsalpinus. The first geological
museum was founded at Verona; the first who cultivated the study of
fossil remains were Leonardo da Vinci and Fracasta. The great chemical
<span class="pag">[391]</span>  discoveries <a id="of391"></a>of this century were made by instruments which bear the
names of Galvani and Volta. Why need I speak of science alone? Who will
dispute with that illustrious people the palm of music and painting, of
statuary and architecture? The dark cloud which for a thousand years has
hung over that beautiful peninsula is fringed with irradiations of light.
There is not a department of human knowledge from which Italy has not
extracted glory, no art that she has not adorned.</p>


<p><span class="side">Causes of her depression.</span>Notwithstanding the adverse circumstances in which she has been placed,
Italy has thus taken no insignificant part in the advancement of science.
I may at the close of a work of which so large a portion has been devoted
to the relation of her influences, political and religious, on the rest
of Europe, be perhaps excused the expression of a hope that the day is
approaching in which she will, with Rome as her capital, take that place
in the modern system to which she is entitled. The course of centuries
has proved that her ecclesiastical relation with foreign countries is
incompatible with her national life. It is that, and that alone, which
has been the cause of all her ills. She has asserted a jurisdiction in
every other government; the price she has paid is her own unity. The
first, the all-important step in her restitution is the reduction of the
papacy to a purely religious element. Her great bishop must no longer be
an earthly prince. Rome, in her outcry for the preservation of her
temporal possessions, forgets that Christian Europe has made a far
greater sacrifice. It has yielded Bethlehem, Gethsemane, Calvary, the
Sepulchre, the Mount of the Ascension. That is a sacrifice to which the
surrender of the fictitious donations of barbarian kings is not to be
compared.</p>

<hr />

<p>The foregoing paragraphs were written in 1859. Since that time Italy has
become a nation, Rome is its capital, Venice belongs to it. In 1870-71 I
was an eye-witness of the presence of Italian troops in the Eternal
City.</p>

<p> <span class="pag">[392]</span>  A Philosophical principle becomes valuable if it can be used as a guide
in the practical purposes of life.</p>




<p><span class="side">General summary of the work.</span>The object of this book is to impress upon its reader a conviction that
civilization does not proceed in an arbitrary manner or by chance, but
that it passes through a determinate succession of stages, and is a
development according to law.</p>


<p><span class="side">Individual and social life have been considered;</span>For this purpose we considered the relations between individual and
social life, and showed that they are physiologically inseparable, and
that the course of communities bears an unmistakable resemblance to the
progress of an individual, and that man is the archetype or exemplar of
society.</p>



<p><span class="side">in the intellectual history of Greece;</span>We then examined the intellectual history of Greece&mdash;a nation offering
the best and most complete illustration of the life of humanity. From the
beginnings of its mythology in old Indian legends and of its philosophy
in Ionia, we saw that it passed through phases like those of the
individual to its decrepitude and death in Alexandria.</p>



<p><span class="side">and the history of Europe.</span> <span class="pag">[393]</span>  Then, addressing ourselves to the history of Europe, we found that, if
suitably divided into groups of ages, these groups, compared with each
other in chronological succession, present a striking resemblance to the
successive phases of Greek life, and therefore to that which Greek life
resembles&mdash;that is to say, individual life.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience in these descriptions we have assumed
arbitrary epochs, answering to the periods from infancy to maturity.
History justifies the assumption of such periods.
<span class="side">The contrasts its ages display.</span>
There is a well-marked
difference between the aspect of Europe during its savage and mythologic
ages; its changing, and growing, and doubting condition during the Roman
republic and the Cæsars; its submissive contentment under the Byzantine
and Italian control; the assertion of its manhood, and right of thought,
and freedom of action which characterize its present state&mdash;a state
adorned by great discoveries in science, great inventions in art,
additions to the comforts of life, improvements in locomotion, and the
communication of intelligence. Science, capital, and machinery conjoined
are producing industrial miracles. Colossal projects are undertaken and
executed, and the whole globe is literally made the theatre of action of
every individual.</p>

<p>Nations, like individuals, are born, pass through a predestined growth,
and die. One comes to its end at an early period and in an untimely way;
another, not until it has gained maturity. One is cut off by feebleness
in its infancy, another is destroyed by civil disease, another commits
political suicide, another lingers in old age. But for every one there is
an orderly way of progress to its final term, whatever that term may be.</p>


<p><span class="side">The object of development is intellect.</span>Now, when we look at the successive phases of individual life, what is it
that we find to be their chief characteristic? Intellectual advancement.
And we consider that maturity is reached when intellect is at its
maximum. The earlier stages are preparatory; they are wholly subordinate
to this.</p>


<p><span class="side">It is the same in individual life, </span>If the anatomist be asked how the human form advances to its highest
perfection, he at once disregards all the <span class="pag">[394]</span>  inferior organs of which it is
composed, and answers that it is through provisions in its nervous
structure for intellectual improvement; that in succession it passes
through stages analogous to those observed in other animals in the
ascending scale, but in the end it leaves them far behind, reaching a
point to which they never attain. The rise in organic development
measures intellectual dignity.</p>


<p><span class="side">and in the animal series, </span>In like manner, the physiologist considering the vast series of animals
now inhabiting the earth with us, ranks them in the order of their
intelligence. He shows that their nervous mechanism unfolds itself upon
the same plan as that of man, and that, as its advancement in this
uniform and predetermined direction is greater, so is the position
attained to higher.</p>


<p><span class="side">and in the general life of the globe.</span>The geologist declares that these conclusions hold good in the history of
the earth, and that there has been an orderly improvement in intellectual
power of the beings that have inhabited it successively. It is manifested
by their nervous systems. He affirms that the cycle of transformation
through which every man must pass is a miniature representation of the
progress of life on the planet. The intention in both cases is the same.</p>


<p><span class="side">Succession of automatism, instinct, and intelligence.</span>The sciences, therefore, join with history in affirming that the great
aim of nature is intellectual improvement. They proclaim that the
successive stages of every individual, from its earliest rudiment to
maturity&mdash;the numberless organic beings now living contemporaneously with
us, and constituting the animal series&mdash;the orderly appearance of that
grand succession which, in the slow lapse of time, has emerged&mdash;all these
three great lines of the manifestation of life furnish not only
evidences, but also proofs of the dominion of law. In all the general
principle is to differentiate instinct from automatism, and then to
differentiate intelligence from instinct. In man himself the three
distinct modes of life occur in an epochal order through childhood to the
most perfect state. And this holding good for the individual, since it is
physiologically impossible to separate him from the race, what <span class="pag">[395]</span>  holds
<a id="good395"></a>good for the one must also hold good for the other. Hence man is truly
the archetype of society. His development is the model of social
progress.</p>


<p><span class="side">The object of social development.</span>What, then, is the conclusion inculcated by these doctrines as regards
the social progress of great communities? It is that all political
institutions&mdash;imperceptibly or visibly, spontaneously or
purposely&mdash;should tend to the improvement and organization of national
intellect.</p>

<p>The expectation of life in a community, as in an individual, increases in
proportion as the artificial condition or laws under which it is living
agree with the natural tendency. Existence may be maintained under very
adverse circumstances for a season; but, for stability and duration, and
prosperity, there must be a correspondence between the artificial
conditions and the natural tendency.</p>


<p><span class="side">Application of these principles to Europe.</span>Europe is now entering on its mature phase of life. Each of its nations
will attempt its own intellectual organization, and will accomplish it
more or less perfectly, as certainly as that bees build combs and fill
them with honey. The excellence of the result will altogether turn on the
suitability and perfection of the means.</p>


<p><span class="side">Example offered by China.</span>There are historical illustrations which throw light upon the working of
these principles. Thus, centuries ago, China entered on her Age of
Reason, and instinctively commenced the operation of mental organization.
What is it that has given to her her wonderful longevity? What is it that
insures the well-being, the prosperity of a population of three hundred
and sixty millions&mdash;more than one fourth of the human race&mdash;on a surface
not by any means as large as Europe? Not geographical position; for,
though the country may in former ages have been safe on the East by
reason of the sea, it has been invaded and conquered from the West. Not a
docility, want of spirit, or submissiveness of the people, for there have
been bloody insurrections. The Chinese empire extends through twenty
degrees of latitude; the mean annual temperature of its northern
provinces differs from that of the southern by twenty-five <span class="pag">[396]</span>  Fahrenheit
degrees. Hence, with a wonderful variety in its vegetation, there must be
great differences in the types of men inhabiting it. But the principle
that lies at the basis of its political system has confronted
successfully all these human varieties, and has outlived all revolutions.</p>


<p><span class="side">She has organized her public intellect,</span>The organization of the national intellect is that principle. A broad
foundation is laid in universal education. It is intended that every
Chinese shall know how to read and write. The special plan then adopted
is that of competitive examinations. The way to public advancement is
open to all. Merit, real or supposed, is the only passport to office. Its
degree determines exclusively social rank. The government is organized on
mental qualifications. The imperial constitution is imitated in those of
the provinces. Once in three years public examinations are held in each
district or county, with a view of ascertaining those who are fit for
office. The bachelors, or those who are successful, are triennially sent
for renewed examination in the provincial capital before two examiners
deputed from the general board of public education. The licentiates thus
sifted out now offer themselves for final examination before the imperial
board at Pekin. Suitable candidates for vacant posts are thus selected.
There is no one who is not liable to such an inquisition. When vacancies
occur they are filled from the list of approved men, who are gradually
elevated to the highest honours.</p>


<p><span class="side"> and obtains stability for her institutions.</span>It is not because the talented, who, when disappointed constitute in
other countries the most dangerous of all classes, are here provided for,
that stability of institutions has been attained, but because the
political system approaches to an agreement with that physiological
condition which guides all social development. The intention is to give a
dominating control to intellect.</p>


<p><span class="side">Imperfection of the method she employs.</span>The method through which that result is aimed at is imperfect, and,
consequently, an absolute coincidence between the system and the tendency
is not attained, but the stability secured by their approximation is very
striking. The method itself is the issue of political forms through which
the nation for <span class="pag">[397]</span>  ages has been passing. Their insufficiency and
imperfections are incorporated with and reappear in it.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its literary basis inadequate.</span>To the practical eye of Europe a political system thus founded on a
literary basis appears to be an absurdity. But we must look with respect
on anything that one-fourth of mankind have concluded it best to do,
especially since they have consistently adhered to their determination
for several thousand years. Forgetting that herein they satisfy an
instinct of humanity which every nation, if it lives long enough, must
feel, Europe often asserts that it is the competitive system which has
brought the Chinese to their present state, and made them a people
without any sense of patriotism or honour, without any faith or vigour.
These are the results, not of their system, but of old age. There are
octogenarians among us as morose, selfish, and conceited as China.</p>


<p><span class="side">Relative position of Europe and China.</span>The want of a clear understanding of our relative position vitiates all
our dealings with that ancient empire. The Chinese has heard of our
discordant opinions, of our intolerance toward those who differ in ideas
from us, of our worship of wealth, and the honour we pay to birth; he has
heard that we sometimes commit political power to men who are so little
above the animals that they can neither read nor write; that we hold
military success in esteem, and regard the profession of arms as the only
suitable occupation for a gentleman. It is so long since his ancestors
thought and acted in that manner that he justifies himself in regarding
us as having scarcely yet emerged from the barbarian stage. On our side,
we cherish the delusion that we shall, by precept or by force, convert him
to our modes of thought, religious or political, and that we can infuse
into his stagnating veins a portion of our enterprise.</p>


<p><span class="side">What China has really accomplished.</span>A trustworthy account of the present condition of China would be a
valuable gift to philosophy, and also to statesmanship. On a former page
I have remarked <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31345/31345-h/31345-h.htm#CHAPTER_I">(Chap.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Vol.&nbsp;I.)</a> that it demands the highest policy to
govern populations living in great differences of latitude. Yet China has
not only controlled <span class="pag">[398]</span>  her climatic strands of people, she has even made
them, if not homogeneous, yet so fitted to each other that they all think
and labour alike. Europe is inevitably hastening to become what China is.
In her we may see what we shall be like when we are old.</p>

<p>A great community, aiming to govern itself by intellect rather than by
coercion, is a spectacle worthy of admiration, even though the mode by
which it endeavours to accomplish its object is plainly inadequate.
<span class="side">Difference in government by force and intelligence.</span>
Brute force holds communities together as an iron nail binds pieces of wood by
the compression it makes&mdash;a compression depending on the force with which
it has been hammered in. It also holds more tenaciously if a little
rusted with age. But intelligence binds like a screw. The things it has
to unite must be carefully adjusted to its thread. It must be gently
turned, not driven and so it retains the consenting parts firmly
together.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the imperfections of a system founded on such a faulty
basis, that great community has accomplished what many consider to be the
object of statesmanship. They think that it should be permanence in
Institutions. But permanence is only, in an apparent sense, the object of
good statesmanship; progression, in accordance with the natural tendency,
is the real one. The successive steps of such a progression follow one
another so imperceptibly that there is a delusive appearance of
permanence. Man is so constituted that he is never aware of continuous
motion. Abrupt variations alone impress his attention.</p>

<p>Forms of government, therefore, are of moment, though not in the manner
commonly supposed. Their value increases in proportion as they permit or
encourage the natural tendency for development to be satisfied.</p>

<p>While Asia has thus furnished an example of the effects of a national
organization of intellect, Europe, on a smaller scale, has presented an
illustration of the same kind.
<span class="side">A similar example in the case of Italy.</span>
The papal system opened, in its special
circumstances, a way for talent. It maintained an intellectual
organization for those who were within its pale, irrespective of wealth
or birth. It was no objection that <span class="pag">[399]</span>  the greatest churchman frequently
came from the lowest walks of life. And that organization sustained it in
spite of the opposition of external circumstances for several centuries
after its supernatural and ostensible basis had completely decayed away.</p>


<p><span class="side">Approach of Europe to universal education.</span>Whatever may be the facts under which, in the different countries of
Europe, such an organization takes place, or the political forms guiding
it, the basis it must rest upon is universal, and, if necessary,
compulsory education. In the more enlightened places the movement has
already nearly reached that point. Already it is an accepted doctrine
that the state, as well as the parent, has rights in a child and that it
may insist on education: conversely also, that every child has a claim
upon the government for good instruction. After providing in the most
liberal manner for that, free countries have but one thing more to do for
the accomplishment of the rest.</p>


<p><span class="side">Necessity of intellectual freedom.</span>That one thing is to secure intellectual freedom as completely as the
rights of property and personal liberty have been already secured.
Philosophical opinions and scientific discoveries are entitled to be
judged of by their truth, not by their relation to existing interests.
The motion of the earth round the sun, the antiquity of the globe, the
origin of species, are doctrines which have had to force their way in the
manner described in this book, not against philosophical opposition, but
opposition of a totally different nature. And yet the interests which
resisted them so strenuously have received no damage from their
establishment beyond that consequent on the discredit of having so
resisted them.</p>

<p>There is no literary crime greater than that of exciting a social, and
especially a theological odium against ideas that are purely scientific,
none against which the disapproval of every educated man ought to be more
strongly expressed. The republic of letters owes it to its own dignity to
tolerate no longer offences of that kind.</p>


<p><span class="side">The future course of Europe.</span>To such an organization of their national intellect, and to giving it a
political control, the countries of Europe are thus rapidly advancing.
They are hastening to satisfy their instinctive tendency. <span class="pag">[400]</span>  The <a id="special400"></a>special
form in which they will embody their intentions must, of course, depend
to a great degree on the political forms under which they have passed
their lives, modified by that approach to homogeneousness which arises
from increased intercommunication. The canal system, so wonderfully
developed in China, exerted no little influence in that respect&mdash;an
influence, however, not to be compared with that which must be the result
of the railway system of Europe.</p>


<p><span class="side">Its hopefulness compared with that of China.</span>In an all-important particular the prospect of Europe is bright. China is
passing through the last stage of civil life in the cheerlessness of
Buddhism; Europe approaches it through Christianity. Universal
benevolence cannot fail to yield a better fruit than unsocial pride.
There is a fairer hope for nations animated by a sincere religious
sentiment, who, whatever their political history may have been, have
always agreed in this, that they were devout, than for a people who
dedicate themselves to a selfish pursuit of material advantages, who have
lost all belief in a future, and are living without any God.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have now come to the end of a work which has occupied me for many
years, and which I submit, with many misgivings as to its execution, to
the indulgent consideration of the public. These pages will not have been
written in vain if the facts they present impress the reader, as they
have impressed the author, with a conviction that the civilization of
Europe has not taken place fortuitously, but in a definite mariner, and
under the control of natural law; that the procession of nations does not
move forward like a dream, without reason or order, but that there is a
predetermined, a solemn march, in which all must join, ever moving, ever
resistlessly advancing, encountering and enduring an inevitable
succession of events; that individual life and its advancement through
successive stages is the model of social life and its secular variations.</p>

<p>I have asserted the control of natural law in the shaping of human
affairs&mdash;a control not inconsistent with free-will any more than the
unavoidable passage of an individual <span class="pag">[401]</span>  as he advances to maturity and
declines in old age is inconsistent with his voluntary actions; that
higher law limits our movements to a certain direction, and guides them
in a certain way. As the Stoics of old used to say, an acorn may lie
torpid in the ground, unable to exert its living force, until it receives
warmth, and moisture, and other things needful for its germination; when
it grows, it may put forth one bud here and another bud there; the wind
may bend one branch, the frost blight another; the innate vitality of the
tree may struggle against adverse conditions or luxuriate in those that
are congenial; but, whatever the circumstances may be, there is an
overruling power for ever constraining and modelling it. The acorn can
only produce an oak.</p>

<p>The application of this principle to human societies is completely
established by a scientific study of their history; and the more
extensive and profound that study, the better shall we be able to
distinguish the invariable law in the midst of the varying events. But
that once thoroughly appreciated, we have gained a philosophical guide
for the interpretation of the past acts of nations, and a prophetic
monitor of their future, so far as prophecy is possible in human
affairs.</p>
